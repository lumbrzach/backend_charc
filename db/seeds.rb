# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

This is a long, deep pool with a shallow rapid entering at the upstream end. There are two rocks sticking out at low water, with fun at both spots. \r\n\r\nThese rocks are the high spots on a hard rock ledge at the top of the pool. In the winter (this is a low elevation, rain fed winter run river)a seam forms as currents converge below an island just upstream. To get the FAT goods, were entering the seam, sinking to head disappearing when the bottom of the slab falls off the underwater ledge. Were doing an underwater eddy turn to keep smoothly dropping with a last couple o strokes, then letting go of the paddle when it pulls, and spiraling smoothly, slowly down with the gloved hands to 6, 8, 10, 12+.... \r\n\r\nLeveling off and flying is fairly easy, once having spent enough time underwater to maintain composure. Consistent 10+ second rides, and plenty of epic rides approaching 20 seconds or more. The 30 second ride is there, no doubt. Many times have I hit the up button, out of breath, still 6-8 feet down. We are using goggles, and 15 visibility is common in the cold water. NOT A SINGLE THING IN THE ROAMING ZONE- TOTALLY SAFE! \r\n\r\nSince discovery in January, 7 people have copped my charc and roamed heavily. Only one had ever had any deep, long rides. \r\n\r\nIt happens during most moderate winter, rainy weather flows- half the year. That would be the cold half- bring a hood! \r\n\r\nBy, Tim H.\r\n\r\nEF Lewis gauge isnt really for this spot..but its a good idication of whether or not it would be in.... the noaa washougal gauge, and the gauge at hathaway park(state ecology dept), both dont seem to tell us if this spot is in.\r\n\r\nThe best way to tell if this spot is in, is visual:  look at the concrete unit that is just down stream on river left.

The spot is at the bottom of the island just downstream.\r\n\r\nWe have had great luck here at this newly found spot, with many epic, deep, long, easy rides. Its a convergence just like the squirt ranch.  the river splits around a small island and creates a sweet convergence coming off the gravel bar point.  both lefties and righties are very easy here.  the deeper water is on the eddy side, so back cutting to the right can result in deep, very slow rides.  there are several major rocks in the deep zone, but so far it has been a very friendly neighborhood.\r\n\r\nJono Der and Tim Hollar first probed out the upper spot at the Weasel, which is now considered to be as good or better than the lower main spot at higher flows.  You can sink at the upper spot and connect under water to the lower spot.  Sweet!\r\n\r\nThis gage release data from 2007 shows that this spot will probably be hold good levels with releases from the dam through June, July, Aug, Sept! These are the most beautiful and sunny months of the year in oregon anyway! A great summer play ground.\r\nhttp://wdr.water.usgs.gov/wy2007/pdfs/14183000.2007.pdf\r\n\r\nPrediction gage for the next couple days...\r\nhttp://ahps2.wrh.noaa.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=pqr&gage=meho3&view=1,1,1,1,1,1\r\n\r\nCamping: \r\nThe best camping as at North Santiam State Park, right at the Weasel.  There are nine first-come-first-served spots on the river, with water and facilities available.  From the campground you can walk or float to the Weasel.  \r\n\r\nthere is also camping 3.6 miles upstream at Fishermans Bend Rec Site.. a BLM site. First come first serve. Its very crowded and Team Nevada said it was full of little kids crying and running around, and therefore they searched out sweeter camping.\r\nhttp://www.blm.gov/or/resources/recreation/files/brochures/Fishermen%20Bend%20Recreation%20Site.pdf\r\n\r\nMore sweet camping is available at Rock Creek Campground in Mill City:\r\nTeam Nevada dialed it in. go into MillCity.. make a right and go down by the bridge which is actually the takeout from the Packsaddle to MillCity run. go over the bridge over the river..youll be on 1st ave. eventually you get to the post office..make a left. now you are on Kingwood Ave. in this same area there is a little grocery store and a laundry mat. going on kingwood ave, youll see a tiny little sign on your left that says Rock Creek campground.. turn right there and the paved road will quickly turn into a gravel road.

For more directions go to www.ozarkpages.com/whitewater and look under creek info. Fishers Ford is just under 30 minutes away from Fayetteville and it can be used year around, even in the dry season. The spot consists of a sloping ledge to the right, the water gains speed and drops off the ledge forming a small hole where the current comes together. The seam is directly behind the hole, both front and back cuts work well from the left and right sides of the current. There is also an excellent eddyline seam further down on the left that you can catch on your way back into the eddy. This is a low water spot usually running 100-400 cfs but never-the-less it yields helmet deep 5+ second rides on a regular basis.

Follow Hwy 16 West toward Siloam and turn on Hwy 244 West a short time after you pass Lake Wedington. Follow 244 for a couple of miles or so and take Cincinati Cr. Rd., a gravel road, to the north. You can look for the old, white Nicodemus Church sign that is mostly hidden by bushes at this turnoff. The Hwy 244 bridge over Cincinati Cr., a medium sized creekbed with a gravel bottom, is just past the turn you need to make, so if you cross it, youve gone a bit too far. If you reach Hwy 59, youve gone a little over a mile too far. Follow the gravel road north about a mile, and youll come to an intersection. Go straight on what is now Fishers Ford Rd. The road makes a few bends, but just keep following it north toward the river. When you come to the old metal bridge, park on the river left, upstream of the bridge and be sure to pull off the road. Dont block the little road leading down to the river by the bridge, since local fishermen use it to lauch johnboats. Unload and walk down to the river and put in and paddle down about 100 yards to the ledge. When youre finished playing, either paddle or walk back up the streambed to get back to the bridge. Please respect landowners rights around this spot, and DONT TRESPASS on the river banks at the ledge, which are clearly posted.

For more directions go to www.ozarkpages.com/whitewater and look under creek info. This is a sedimentary creek which means it has deep pools and clean eddylines. There are many different runs possible on this river and nearly every eddy yields at least neck to helmet deep mysteries. But there are several specific spots that must be mentioned. From the put in at the Little Mulberry Creek to the take out at Birds Canoe rental (8miles which can be broken up many different ways) there are three main downtime arenas. \r\n\r\nNOTE:This spot had changed last time I was there in the spring of 2007 and was not as good for DT.\r\n1st: just around the corner from a low water bridge crossing is a rapid called PHD which has changed in the last 3 years to a mystery paradise. The current splits with the main channel flowing straight into the bank which creates 2 very powerful elevator eddies, the smaller channel comes in from the right at a 90% angle creating a crazy stationary whirlpool. This spot is tricky but has yielded 10-15+ sec deep mysteries during which there was no downstream movement, very unique and cool playground. \r\n\r\n2nd: about 2 miles below High Bank Access area the river narrows and runs along a rock wall on the river right. You will see a strong elevator eddy at the top and directly behind it is a smaller eddy on the right along the bluff. At the top of this eddy the river drops over a ledge and if you can catch the surge you are rewarded with a very fast and powerful mystery. Be careful to stay on a level flight path because the river is not very deep, although your head will still be at least 3 feet under water. There is also an access point just below this rapid, if the level is 3-3.5 feet on the gauge you can easily spend a lot of time here. \r\n\r\n3rd: 2 miles from the take out at Birds, directly below the largest rapid, Whoop and Holler (it is the ozarks), a ledge extends out from the river right and creates a very strong eddy with good downtime potential. It is fairly difficult to figure out but there have been some long deep rides here. \r\n\r\nThese are just 3 highlights of this short run on the mulberry, I have at least 3 other places downstream that have very good potential. The Mulberry River is an excellent squirt run, easy rapids, deep eddylines, and beautiful scenery. \r\n\r\nI have squirted the Mulberry for 9 years now and it is still one of my favorites. \r\n\r\nDirections\r\n\r\nNewton, Johnson, and Franklin Co., S1: Take Hwy. 23 north of Ozark form I-40.

It is a left after your second of two small yellow bridges. It is the Carry Brook emergency access road. Follow the road all the way in to the parking lot. This will be your take out unless you want to do the 8 mile float out in your glass boat. Treck back out of this road and take a left back onto the main dirt road. This will lead you right into Harris Station. You will encounter and FPL (Florida Power and Light) gate where I believe the gate fee is still a dollar. Driver through the gate and stay on the pavement and head into the parking lot. If you get there real early (8am) you may be able to drive down and drop off boats. This is a commercially run river with 1200 allocations a day for the commercial rafting season. The\r\nrafts put in from 10am to 12pm and water flows are typically from 10am-2pm. Try and put in after the rafts, otherwise you will be avoiding tons of SPORTS (stupid people on rafting trips). The Gorge itself is characterized by 70ft cliff walls and very string and pushy currents. The river itself is very deep and having been down at fish level flows there are limited to no bottom hazards to be wary off while going deep. There are\r\nnumerous mystery spots along the river with the first being right off the bat at The Throat where the river begins to pick up momentum. Cathedral Eddy is also full of numerous lines varying in strength and all kinds of large boil lines to have\r\nfun with. There are usually a handful of squirters on the Kennebec on any given day and many private boaters to help with shuttle.\r\nCamping accommodations are numerous and river lies flow at The Marshall Hotel after a few beers. The water is incredibly clean and very warm in the middle of the summer.\r\n\r\nBy, Andrew Whitaker\r\n\r\nFor the latest flow information call (800) 557-3569 Dial 5 for Kennebec.','','cfs','','moderate','','2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400', '2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400'),

Although nothing epic, it does provide some down time at wide range of flows from spring high water to summer minimums. During summer, the difference in temperature between the Delaware & spring fed Bushkill can be 20 degrees or more, adding a new sensation to the help balance on the convergence line. You need to be in predominantly cold flows to get the Beaver Slap on the main seam - too much warm water & you only go neck deep and shoot over the strong suck zone. \r\n\r\nTOPOLOGY:\r\nThe feature is formed by a portion of the Delaware flowing between an island and the PA shore, then over a crumbling 2-step dam. Flow from the Bushkill Creek joins from river right at right angles flowing across the base of the dam.\r\n\r\nPREDICTED LEVELS:\r\nTo predict levels a few days in advance use the following link (5-7ft is 6-13kcfs)...\r\nhttp://newweb.erh.noaa.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=phi&gage=BVDN4\r\n\r\nCHARCS:\r\nAt high water >11 kcfs the working area is right next the PA bank ~ 8ft up the Delaware from the Bushkill. There is a small eddy that feeds up to the upper step of the dam. Slip your bow into the downstream flow, just above the dam crest and set your hip as it swings past the lip of the dam. In most situations youll drop to within a few inches of the dam shelf, putting your head 1 ft under for a couple rotations. The shelf is ~10ft wide before dropping over the second drop into the Bushkill flow. The obstacle to extended DT is the reaction flow off the first drop bouncing off the ledge, causing an upswell just before the second drop. If you make it through that you can take advantage of the Bushkill currents to drop further.\r\n\r\nAt flows below 10kcfs the line moves out to the center of the dam where the upper section has collapsed onto the shelf. Depending on the levels it is possible to initiate off the remains of the top lip & float neck deep down to the second ledge where the two streams converge & drop, this is the 9 kcfs charc. \r\n\r\nIf the level is too low for that youll need to find the convergence of the two flows, cross over the Bushkill current & engage the Delaware flow at a point high enough up that youll get the drop off the second ledge and be able to spin your 1/4 or 3/4 turns to engage your edge the the converging Bushkill flows. The tricky part of all this is the variability of the two stream flows makes the convergence point move around from day to day. \r\n\r\nBelow 6500 or so there is a small eddy formed to the left of center in the main dam flow by a chunk of the upper dam creating a pourover & then a full fledged eddy. This can be used to stage for lefty charc into the convergence of the two streams as mentioned above or to use a righty into the main flow wave train. The convergence zone at the end of this eddy  can be quite strong resulting in a full mush to the unwary.\r\n\r\nLOCATION:\r\nBeaver Drop is 100 yds north of US-22 on PA 611 North. \r\n\r\nIf arriving in Easton on I-78 youll follow signs for downtown & 611 N. On 611 you pass a green link bar suspension bridge (free to/from NJ) on your right, as you approach the second bridge on  US-22 (tol from NJ to PA only), turn right to go under the bridge and stay on 611 N. After looping under the bridge you come to stop sign and a right turn onto the bridge over the Bushkill, look for a parking spot on the road. The path down to the creek is off the triangle of grass between the two streams & the road.\r\n\r\nIf coming from NJ on US-22 take the exit immediately off the toll bridge & find a parking spot.\r\n\r\nIf coming from the west on US-22, exit at the 4th Street exit (last exit in PA). Bear left at the light at the end of the ramp. Get into the left turn lane for the next light @ 3rd St. Turn left under US-22 & pass through the next light. As 3rd St bears right to climb the hill, turn right onto Bushkill Drive, a one-way road along the base of the hill. At the stop sign, turn right onto 611 South, park on or after the bridge.\r\n\r\nTimothy Luce','01446500','cfs','','moderate','','2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400', '2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400'),

Please be aware that getting to and from the first spot requires passing through Class 3 and 4 water.\r\n\r\nThe next and probably the best spot on the river is 100 yards up stream from the takeout. There is a rock in the middle of the flow that only barely sticks out of the water. Enter the seam at 45%, as the water builds on the rock dive you bow in about a foot deep then impact your hip. You will get a good 5-10 second ride here. This spot has the potential for longer rides. There is one problem with the takeout spot.

I have to first off give credit to Chris Martin, as he was the one who first told me of the spot a few years back. We looked at it, and Chris tried hopping into it without a whole ton of success, so I kinda wrote it off. I went back there today to actually try it myself, and I was floored. The spot is on the Fife Brook section of the Deerfield river in Massachusetts. The spot is at the confluence with the\r\ncold river, but the squeeze and the eddyline are actually formed by the convergence of the Deerfield with itself after it wraps around an island.  The entire thing reminds me of smoothy as far as entry and things like that are concerned. The eddyline is extremely benign looking... it looks just like a small convergence of currents feeding into a deep pool. There are no real whirlpools, and not really many boils to speak of. The entry is almost exactly like smoothy once you get near the squeeze. What you do is paddle down the main current and across the small V shaped eddy just above the convergence. you aim for the secondary current that meets the main flow just above the convergence. You hit the current and drop up to your shoulders, and slow motion screw down as you get sucked towards the squeeze. When you\r\nhit the squeeze, its just like smoothy...you feel the tug, grab a breath and drop in. Once youre down its incredibly smooth...I dare say smoother than smoothy. There is almost no current underwater, and not a whole lot of layers to speak of. however, once youre in, there isnt much that brings you back to the surface. If you hit it right, you will continue to drop deeper and deeper (6-7 ft), otherwise you can just hang 2-3 ft. below the surface as long as you can hold your breath. It reminds me a bit of the spot at pushbutton on the Ottawa (the little swirlies in the flatwater near the island) in that there isnt much current there, but once youre in you will just hang at the same level forever. The water is incredibly clear, and you can see the surface above you the whole time cause its basically flatwater above. I was consistently hitting big rides (15 sec range) and it was extremely easy on the body. Its defiantly a long boat spot, cause you need a boat that can just sorta hang underwater, but if you have the right boat and\r\ndecent technique at screwing in, hold your breath! Im pissed I never went there before this. I feel like a little kid on x-mas right now, you couldnt tear the smile off my face. The spot is park and play. Its a benign looking spot, but if you have the screwing down charc dialed you can go big there. \r\nIts a long boat/ hands paddle spot for sure.

This is the last parking spot that is close, so we want to protect it.\r\n4 - Grab your boat and gear, cross the railroad tracks onto Rte 2, turn right and walk .2 miles.  The mystery spot will be on your right where the two rivers converge. Look for the path marked by stickers on the guard rail.  If you don\\\\t want to cross the railroad track or if there is a train, you can walk back down Tea ST Exd, turn right and walk .3 miles.\r\n\r\nWater gets to CJ about three hours after it is released from the Fifebrook Dam and (as you can figure) shuts off at CJ three hours after the flow is shut off at the Fifebrook Dam.  \r\n\r\nClosest camping is at Mohawk Trail State Forest, about 3 mins / 1.2 miles from CJ:\r\nhttp://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/western/mhwk.htm\r\n\r\nA little more history, I met up with Chris Martin one day after running the dryway in 2001.

Its tidal so its saltwater. The feature works all year round and the water is quite warm in the summer months. \r\n\r\nHowever Clifden only works on Spring Tides, the feature forms about 2 hours before Galway Harbour High tide. The tide must be 14 foot+ to be any good. It works best at around 16 ft +/-.\r\nIts a great place to be for a couple of nights with friends. For camping go to Dun Loughan, a nearby beach with camping in the dunes. There can be surf here as well if youre lucky. \r\n\r\nHow to get there \r\nTake the N59 out of Galway City which leads directly to Clifden which is about 70km from Galway. The drive is through one of the most scenic areas of Ireland, Connemara. When in Clifden you need to take the road to Ballyconeeley. So drive into the town and as you approach Market street instead of turning right onto this street go straight ahead. The road narrows and you drive over a small bridge. The road widens again as you leave the town and drive for about 1 km and you will see a school on your right. Park here. \r\n\r\nYou can paddle across the saltlake to the hole from here (10 mins paddle). Climb over the wall on the opposite side of the road and paddle across the bay to the right until you come to the bridge. \r\n\r\nIf you want to drive and take a look: about another half a kilometer from the school is the bridge and arches that form the hole. \r\n\r\nTo find dun Loughan (good luck with this!) head towards Ballyconeley but turn right before here. Youre looking for a turn to the right - the sign says dunloughan but its hard to see - instead look for a no dumping sign. Drive down here until there are three sand paths. Follow one of these across the dunes untill you come to the beach. Find somewhere to camp here. Be discrete and clean up before leaving and respect the local area please! \r\n\r\nIf you are in Galway city pick up tide tables from Galway Harbour Company behind the docks or from Galway Maritime on Merchants Road. Also River Deep Mountain High have tide tables and can give you advice. Failing this chase Internet tides but I cant guarantee how accurate this is. Ive always used Galway Harbor Company Tide tables! \r\n\r\nThe land around the saltlake is private property - please respect the area. Thats why it is best to park at the school and paddle across the lake. Please do not block any gates.','','cfs','','moderate','','2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400', '2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400'),

It lies about 100 yards below Calamity Rock Rapid on the Narrows section of the Cheat- 10 miles upstream of the Canyon. It is frequented throughout the summer because the medium low levels are the best. \r\n  There are many charcs available- most of them developed in recent years.  The favorite charcs are available at the medium levels and are based off the eddy in the middle of the river(attainers left of the slab).  The easiest charc is to go backcut and travel.  You can also go backcut and stall and hang around 5-6 deep in the Ballroom at the top of a boil pile in the eddy.  At this point you can spin much faster without traveling.  The best realmhogs often leave this arena by dropping deeper and then traveling.  You can also go very high in the eddy and drop hard and stall right next to the rock, spinning slowly (you might bump the rock). \r\n  You can also get traveling and Ballroom charcs going regular and/or dropping early.  The traveling charcs tend to be initiated in the back of the second baby wave at the top of the eddyline.  But you can also initiate regular on the attainers right side of the first wave-  Carls Charc-  named after Carl Gittings who pioneered the righty regular charcs here.\r\n\r\n  The river left charcs tend to be simpler- but yield good results at the lower levels.  The easiest charcs are basically a lefty regular where you drop steep and fast and come back for support from the eddy- traveling slowly spinning.  The other lefty is where you drop about 3 from the shore rock- tapping into a subtle seam generated from the rocks pillow and drop deep and cross the slab to get support from the river right eddy.  There you stall until the mystery plays out.  A final regular charc is to drop hard and travel to the boil piles on river left down below and exploit them for all youre worth.  Backcut charcs are also available but tend to stall pretty much- although you can get your head wet pretty well.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are driving up from Albright- head towards Rowlesburg and after you see some easy class 3 rapids close to the road slow down and look for a huge rock in the river as high as the road (the road is bending right here).  The next pull off to the left is the parking spot (like a 20 car spot).  There is a trail down at the upstream and downstream ends of the parking  lot.  The downstream trail is the easiest but often has locals partyin it up- so dont leave shoes on the shore here.   The Alley is at the top of the eddy here (duh).\r\n\r\n\r\nCFS at Albright is the way to go. Anything 700-1,800 is worth traveling for.

Good squirt boaters can achieve blasting transitions and shudder Rudders at will here although it isnt easy. There is an excellent mystery spot on downstream 100 feet just to the left of the big splat rock. Here the currents pile into steep sided bedrock slabs which form the river left shore and form ponderous but fickle seams. The trick is to wait just on the upstream flow section of the seam area and wait for a big seam to lumber your way. When it does attack it quickly and drop fast winging down hard but level into the encroaching slab and seam. If you get lucky your head will disappear for a few seconds and you will get up to 4 deep as you spin. This is a very powerful and dynamic arena and doesnt lend itself well to roaming.

After the flood of 1996 the pool level below the slide type hole dropped 2 and destroyed the mystery capabilities the arena had. When it was good- from 1985-1996 you could easily get 3-5 seconds DT and often 8-10 seconds. This was one of the first places where paddlers experimented with big DT (over 6 seconds). It was named by Jim Snyder after Paul Marshall named the flume-like drop below it- the Cyclotron in the spring of 1986. The Cyclotron disappeared in the flood of 1996. The best charc was breaking left from the center to dive with a shallow charc into the thin slab and drop sideways to a point where the bedrock bottom fell away. At this point you could drop deeper into an underwater eddy with the currents passing just over your head. Then when you had enough you could easily hit the up button and erupt vertically next to the waiting mystery riders. A few people and boats were speared this way with rude bows. You could also break right from the center and get respectable DT although you would often travel in this mode and so couldnt roam as peacefully. In the final days before the 1996 flood, squirt boaters were starting to have a problem with boogie board riders who would drop in for verrry long rides- to the excitement of no one. They ended up trying to work next to the boogie boardom and that was often a successful solution. When Recyc was big - anything over 3- it was (and still is) way burly and gave violent and dynamic- although not impossible rides. Jeff Snyder was master of riding these levels- often jumping in at 6 and higher. At this level the foam pile is at least 6 tall and 50 wide and the slab is about 2 thick. The ride is often so violent you often become an end throwing speck. Jeff seemed to bide his time calmly and well though in all conditions.

It lies around the corner from Pillow Rock and is a very obscure ripple in the currents below a riffle- pretty much in the center of the now sedated river. The most used charc is a slow dropping backcut. Come out of the attainers right eddy with a lot of speed to cross the 30 of currents you need to. Use this speed to transfer into a lateral dropping charc as you wing down with the left hip to tap into meager currents falling off an underwater ledge. Stay very flat and spin slowly and expect a second push of energy from the significant downstream currents you just crossed. People who get really big DT here (over 7 seconds) then tap into a juicy seam which starts right after the initiation zone and proceeds very far downstream. You can turn slowly or just proceed downstream on a kind of straight mush move like charc. You can also use a regular charc- bearing your bow to the left in the initiation zone- but this is a complicated charc which is really a sophisticated form of mush move bearing left and looking downstream.

The best levels are 2,000- 2,500 cfs. People rarely do it right. This is firstly difficult because rafts often tie up in the eddy for long lunches and completely block the entrance charc. HAHA! Tough Luck they laugh. If there are no rafts there it is still a difficult approach. There are strong currents encroaching from the right as they exit the Room of Doom. Then you are pressed close to the undercut Postage Due rock - whos steep face often gets in the way of your right blade. because of this it is advisable to enter the approach eddy with some speed so you can coast through the tenuous final feet before you engage the slab. Enter the slab within two feet of the rock. You dont need a steep dive but you would do well to wing down strongly. You will zoom into travel mode quickly and finally encounter support from the eddy about 10-15 downstream. If you have been able to get deep by this point you are in for some real big DT- over 10 seconds. You may travel a bit downstream and chances are you will be at least 4-6 deep. Remember to exit breaking left to re- attain the eddy before you travel too far downstream or getting back will be very difficult. A cool aspect of this arena is that it usually features many hundreds of raft customer spectators who get their first look at mystery moves.

On Google map, from the Y the left road is County Road # 22/1 (Vinton Road) and the right road is Panther Mtn Road, or Poe Vinton, or County Road # 11/1\r\n4. Go over a large hill on County Road # 11/1 and drop down the other side.\r\n5. At the T intersection (with COunty Road #22), turn left. When you see a field on the left after about 100 yards, turn in and park.\r\n6. Heres a link to a Google map of the field. You can back-track from there.\r\n\r\nhttp://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=poe,+wv&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=50.777825,78.837891&ie=UTF8&ll=38.226428,-80.992584&spn=0.003102,0.004812&t=h&z=18','03192000','cfs','15','epic','','2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400', '2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400'),

It was named by Dale Adams around 1993 (?). Its against the river right shore and plunges deeply off the side of an small underwater rock. You come in with speed but coast your final charc (good technique anywhere). Come in very close to the rock- almost scraping it and dive steep and fast with a plunging charc while you wing down hard in a vertical mode. You will soon gain support of the eddy which powers up the slabs ability to drive you deep. Good riders can easily go very deep for over 7 seconds. There is a bit of travel involved but its not like youre roaming. You can also do powered up exits because the squeeze here is sooo dynamic. Timid or inexperienced boaters usually get lesser results here. Keep your charc clean and simple because this place is so powered up that it can torque your body if you are waffling around. Dont fight it- find your way to the center of the earth here. If you put too much into it- it will bite back and you might even end up getting dogged around or doing an ignoble roll in front of your friends. So be careful- but enjoy!

Which isnt to say its not fickle. Even homeboys often sample the Sister for an hour before she yields the good stuff. It is about 2 miles into the Lower Gauley near some play waves which are usually littered with plastic- above Upper Mash Rapid. It is a mere wrinkle at the way bottom left of the rapid. It features an underwater ledge- where you get your down force, a large supporting eddy- which maintains excellent downtime, and a couple noteworthy rocks- which it behooves you to work around. It is successfully worked with regular and backcut charcs. Big downtime here is over 20 seconds and involves a lot of travel- but that is the Schnelle Zone. Most paddlers tap into 3-7 second drops with excellent sweet aesthetics. It was named by Eric Lindberg and Whitney Shields around 1990 and has remained a favored haunt of shadow riders since then. It was named that because they liked the name- not because of anything going down easy or juicy seams or anything like that. The regular charc usually yields the best downtime but is often hard to cypher out- especially for beginners here. The trick is to leave the eddy consistently- about15-18 inches away from the upstream rock. Travel with some speed across the approach currents hitting you from the right and generate some lateral speed which will feed you into the maw of the abyss. Look for the farthest right corner of the mini-wave there and approach that spot with your bow sunk about 1 but sitting up centered over your wing. The idea is to engage your hip fully and smoothly in the upstream slab which is plummeting quietly over the invisible ledge. If you do it right you bow will clear over the ledge with only inches to spare- even though the ledge is about 15 under the surface and hard to see. Use a single sustained stroke to smooth and guide the impact with the slab. Once you hit- drop fast with a smooth wingdown and turn back sharply into the eddy. This is not a good time to travel. Once youve re-established contact with the eddy you can keep spinning at a nice pace and prolong your downtime. There are special concerns about traveling too far here also- which I will mention later. Another good option is to drop fast to about 4 deep and then do a full loop (barrel roll) on your way back to the surface. This is where loops were first developed by Jim Snyder in the fall of 1996. You can also wait until you are nearly breaking the surface and do a Retarded Loop or wait until your head breaks the surface and do a Light Loop. You can also do stunning and awesome mobiusequences here to really show your stuff- although homeboys almost never do because they are saving their energy and feet for downtime. The backcut charc is also very effective here. Approach the same way but a bit more downstream like you are trying to catch a surf on the mini-wave. Then deeply engage your bow in the furthest right tiniest corner of the mini-wave and use a powerful sustained up-directed backstroke on the right to jam your left hip into the slab. You dont need to wingdown much here because you are going down big time no matter what if youve done the approach right. The best thing to do next is to stall or use some magic force to sustain spins against the whirlpool energies. No one knows exactly how this works- but it sure does here! Its also fun and effective to stop your spin and reverse it. The one thing its not a good idea to do is to travel fast backwards along the ledge in this mode. There are 2 underwater rocks of concern here. Both are about 4.5 deep and a ways away from the drop zone but still quite accessible. They are called the Pinning Rock and the Rock That Waits. The Pinning Rock is out in the center of the river and is usually encountered by mystery riders traveling backwards along the ledge from a backcut approach. You will get there in about 3 seconds from a very deep drop and will have a half second of turbulence to warn you that a hard crash is imminent. This is your one chance to hit the up button. Often people who drop deep and travel here see shadows of neighboring rocks pass by above them on their way. If you hit the rock- which has been done too often- quickly turn vertical and try to splat your way off the face. People who impact this rock often get deep scars on their hulls and report that the hull crushed on them- a very bad sign. But no one has ever been pinned seriously and most people just live by the discipline of not roaming into the neighborhood. The Rock That Waits gets a lot of visitors. It is down in the eddy- just on the eddy side of the eddy line about 25 downstream of the drop zone. It takes a deep drop and about 3.5 turns to find yourself parked there. You have to stay deep the whole way to really visit. When Jeff Schnelle gets his big downtime here he has to navigate past this rock underwater. Im not sure its well marked at all, but there is distinct turbulence for a full second before you get there. A good way to guarantee that you will never park on the rock is to keep your boat only 4 deep in this area. This way you will pass over the rock for sure. Five feet deep is asking for it though- so be precise. It helps to open your eyes and keep a reading on the surface so you know how deep you are if you venture down that way. There have been a large number of pins and whacks on this rock and no one has been crushed badly on it- although Knuckle Down Guthrie got his moniker by mauling his innocent hand between the rock and his boat once. Its pretty benign though and theres a chance that Dans choice of coffee had something to do with the incident. The beauty of this spot is that it is easy on the body and yields very consistent good results for practiced players here. It is a high point of the year for mystery artists and there are sublime gatherings which occur in the fall season. Its a classic Mecca that should be on every squirt boaters list of places to visit. \r\nBy Jim Snyder\r\n\r\nCheck to see if there is a dam release at the US Army Corps:\r\nhttp://www.lrh-wc.usace.army.mil/wc/wwsched.html\r\n\r\nDirections to Twisted:\r\n\r\n1.

It was named around 1979- before squirt boating began- when river guides used to amuse themselves by swimming the whirlpools after being shown how by Tim Kanannen. It is one of the first arenas where squirt boaters sought out big DT. It is exceedingly fickle and yet serves up major downtime to true devotees. The best levels are when it is pretty low and stable- from 0 to -2. A major portion of the river is slamming off a huge rock at the way bottom left of Lower Keeney Rapid. The river is quite deep here, even at low levels, although the bottom has been touched a very few times by people who dive deeply into the hearts of big whirlpools. The charc involves breaking out from behind the rock bearing left. For the best DT you need to turn sharply underwater before you travel too far and tap back into the eddy for support. This requires engaging the slab very close to the rock- within about a foot of it- and winging down hard right away semi-vertically. Many people waste hours here by making the mistake of dropping too slowly and trying to link up with an obvious seam about 3 out which is derived from the pillow formed by the rock. You can link up with the seam but you rarely get any good downtime at all because you travel fast without spinning and lose any support from the eddy. Some people, like Jeff Schnelle, get huge DT here and do travel to get it- about 50-80 in 20-25 seconds. But it is all based off an initial deep drop and using support from the river left eddy. Sometimes you can get a good ride by traveling across the currents underwater and downstream a bit and tapping into the river right eddy. But this is very dynamic travel and usually peoples up buttons get greasy from all the action and they have premature evacuations. At any rate, this is a superb place to play for many hours and you have to pace yourself, bring drinks, snacks and rest periodically to get the best of the arena. \r\nBy Jim Snyder\r\n\r\nLook at this conversion page to get the current flow:\r\nhttp://www.wvwa.net/cgi-bin/nrg.pl\r\n\r\nThe Halls of Karma is located at the bottom of Lower Keeney Rapid on the New River Gorge.\r\n \r\nFrom the town of Winona high on the river-right plateau, drive down Keeney Creek on a winding dirt road.

You can generally park about 4 to 6 cars at this turnout.\r\n \r\nDirectly across from the turnout is a guard rail. Look for the trail that drops into the woods below.

(http://www.americanwhitewater.org/rivers/id/1981/)\r\n\r\nThe spot is called Red Hole, and it‚Äôs about 2/3s of the way down the run through Passage Creek Gorge. It is road side and can be easily located just above the nice rapid with a rock retaining wall against the road on the river left side. The actual spot is on the river left side, and it is a seam/eddyline that comes off of a small six inch ledge. The ledge is angled from left to right going downstream. The prime entry point is about two feet in from the end of the ledge/seam, and is best attacked with a regular charc going left, and shallow hip angle. If you hit it in the right place, the drop is effortless and instantaneous, and a steep forceful entry is not necessary. The hydrodynamics of the ledge is similar to Last Chance at the takeout of the Upper G, but going left instead of right and the ledge is angled downstream a bit more. Once you get the hang of Red Hole, you can roam easily even without an entry stroke. At the prime levels, even a novice mystery mover will sink out of sight with ease. Many times you will bounce smoothly along the sandy/gravel bottom for 8-10 seconds before emerging ten or fifteen yards downstream. In my experience, I have yet to find any spot that dishes out such high success with minimal effort. Below the spot is a thirty yard pool before the river runs into the next rapid, and the eddy on river left at the spot is plenty big. One major drawback is trout fishermen. In season, the stream is choked with fisherman and Red Hole is definitely a favorite fishing spot. It is also a favorite summer swimming hole for locals, but usually the creek is far too low in the summer months. \r\n\r\nAnything above one foot on the painted route 55 gage will work, with prime levels between 1.5 ‚Äì 3 feet.

The rides at Mellow Ledge are deep, long, smooth and, of course, mellow!\r\n\r\nMellow Ledge has the distinction of being in range more days per year than any other Mystery realm in West Virginia. Mellow Ledge runs all winter but it is usually too cold squirt. In March-April the temperatures become tolerable and Mellow Ledge stays in range all the way until summer. This is the best time to catch Mellow Ledge.\r\n\r\nMellow Ledge is located between Millers Folly (Undercut) and Thread the Needle on the New River Gorge. The local squirting boating pro calls the spot Millers Folly instead of Mellow Ledge.\r\n\r\nI remember the first time I saw Mellow Ledge... Carl Gittings and I ran the New River gorge in squirt boats one freezing, rainy December afternoon. We mushed into the eddy line at Mellow Ledge on our way down river. The bubbles rising calmly to the surface gave me the impression that this was a very deep and special Mystery realm. We were too cold to stop and explore as our session at the Halls of Karma had put us on the verge of hypothermia. My butt was frozen and we had to get off the river. We would have to sample Mellow Ledge another day.\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS\r\n\r\nMellow Ledge is on river left, directly across from the confluence of Fern Creek. To get there, park at the takeout below the bridge (WHAT BRIDGE?) and walk up the railroad tracks 1/2-mile on river left. Past the first gentle bend in the tracks, you will see a 10-foot boulder up ahead, left of the tracks. About 20 yards upstream of this boulder there is a telephone pole. Another 10 yards upstream of this pole you will find a steep trail that leads directly down to Mellow Ledge. Early in the season look through the bare trees for Fern Creek on the other side of the river.\r\n\r\nHYDRODYNAMICS\r\n\r\nThe eddy line at Mellow Ledge is formed by currents that spiral off the sloping edge of a very large, rectangular boulder that lays almost flat in the water. Regular lefty charcs are the norm at Mellow Ledge. (Back cuts have not been very fruitful here.) You will notice a large pillow on the upstream side of the boulder. Slice in at the interface between this pillow and the currents passing downstream.\r\n\r\nThe initial drop will take you spinning down the sloping face of the boulder. You may grind your stern on the way down if you are too close to the rock on the entry. When you drop off the edge of the boulder (2 to 3 spins) you will drop again and go deep (the double suck). \r\n\r\nIn the middle of your long and gentle ride, you may find yourself bumping into an underwater pillow that suddenly drives you to the surface. You can screw down behind this pillow (the triple suck) into a really long and deep ride. This pillow is formed a large sloping boulder (Kind Rock) but no one has ever hit it.\r\n\r\nGAUGE\r\n\r\nThe gauge for Mellow Ledge is the Thurmond USGS gauge:\r\nhttp://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Gauge2/detail/id/43472/\r\n\r\nThe Hinton gauge is about 12 hours upstream and helps with predicting levels due to dam release.\r\n\r\nLOW WATER\r\n\r\nThe bare minimum flow for rides at Mellow Ledge is just under 4500 cfs. Hand paddles are best at low flow because you really have to screw down to catch the double-suck. Long, deep rides are still possible but not consistently obtained.\r\n\r\nIDEAL LEVELS\r\n\r\nThe ideal levels are between 5800 to 7400 cfs. The rides are fantastically deep and very easy on the body. How good is it? I can spend a whole day at Mellow Ledge at this level and not miss a single ride. What does that tell you? Some who have sampled this spot at ideal levels have argued that Mellow Ledge is better than Halls of Karma. Yeah, you read that correctly. Better than Halls of Karma.\r\n\r\nThe only problem with the ideal levels is that you will go so deep and so long that you will surface in the 2nd or 3rd eddy.\r\n\r\nA ride into the 2nd eddy is not a big deal, but you will have to attain back up into the 1st eddy. Attaining can be a real PITA for hand paddlers at these higher levels. Fortunately a sneak opens up through the boulders at about 7400 cfs, which allows you to pull or push yourself up and over some rocks back into the 1st eddy. I like to go through the sneak backwards so that I am pushing myself over the rocks, not pulling myself.\r\n\r\nA ride into the 3rd eddy, while fantastically long, necessitates getting out of your boat and carrying over the boulders back to Mellow Ledge. The first ride into the 3rd eddy: THAT WAS TOTALLY AWESOME! Second time: Oh, that was cool. Third time: I am NOT doing that again.\r\n\r\nHIGH WATER\r\n\r\nAt 9300 cfs the rock is underwater and Mellow Ledge is just a large, sticky hole. The eddy is almost gone. You can still get mysteries, but it is a ton of work battling the current. The charc is essentially the same as at lower levels. You will surface in the 3rd eddy.\r\n\r\nI heard rumors that the old-school Projet crowd likes Mellow Ledge in the 9300 to 9800 cfs range. That makes sense. Projets have the speed to stay in the fast-moving eddy and the hole is powerful enough to sink a large-volume boat like a Project.\r\n\r\nBETA FOR TRAVELERS\r\n\r\nOne old-timer reported that he will not travel 3 hours to Mellow Ledge unless the level is at least 3 feet (5800 cfs). That is not bad advice if you are heading in from out of town. Check the prediction URL above to see what Hinton is doing or going to do (12 hours upstream).\r\n\r\nPARKING\r\n\r\nMellow Ledge does not handle crowds very well. The eddy can handle 4 boats max. Finding a place to get out of your boat is always a problem. The river bank is a jumble of large boulders and you will be able to find only one docking station at any given level.\r\n\r\nAt low levels there is a sloping ledge where you can get out of your boat. This ledge is at the upstream corner of the rock that forms Mellow Ledge. It is immediately upstream of a big undercut that keeps the ferry interesting.\r\n\r\nAt high levels there is a protected harbor near the bottom of the first eddy. Even if you cannot find a place to dock, at least you can do a wet exit in shallow water.\r\n\r\nAESTHETICS\r\n\r\nMellow Ledge is in the sun until late in the day. However, the rocks on shore go into the shade quite a bit earlier. It is not the best place to be on a cold day. Dress warmly. Early in the season gloves and hoods are a good idea.\r\n\r\nALTERNATIVE PLAYGROUNDS\r\n\r\nOn your way down river back to the takeout, stop at Thread the Needle for a few dips. Its fun place.\r\n\r\nIf the water is too low for Mellow Ledge, then check out Thread the Needle (best at 2500 to 4500 cfs). If the water is even lower than that, then check out Halls of Karma (1200 to 2700 cfs). If the water is too high for Mellow Ledge, then see what is running on the the Gauley.\r\n\r\nMellow Ledge is a groovy place, baby.\r\n-Harry','03185400','cfs','13','epic','','2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400', '2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400'),

It is over forty-five feet deep underneath the bridge according to some SCUBA divers I ran into when the river was a lot lower!\r\n\r\nTake off the river just after Target rock rapid if you want to avoid this monster whirlpool. The whirlpool forms underneath the bridge at Virginia State University at higher water. If you can see the bridge think about getting off the river. You can scout this easily when you set up your shuttle before getting on the river. There is a dam 200 yards down river of this whirlpool which adds to the danger.

Its a short hike up over the O-Deck peninsula to get to the bowl. We put in at a rocky cove and ferry across the Horseshoe current to an eddy below the Streamers on river right. When this spot is above 3.3 feet it is difficult to get back in the staging eddy on river right. The strong current usually forces you to eddy out in the eddy below the Flake/Spout. An accomplished squirter can easily wing down at this interface in either direction, a regular mystery charc will be to the right spinning with the current and backcut mystery charc will be to the left against the current. At any level in order to have success, you need to sink early, before you get to the current coming from the Horseshoe. Theres a little curler that forms at the seam, you need to have your boat already under when you get to the curler. The FishBowl isnt torquey except at the higher levels above 3.2. Its actually very safe compared to Bermuda or Simple Pleasures, or most spots on the Potomac for that matter. I know of no one whos touched bottom or encountered submerged rocks. This is one of the Potomacs premier spots for roaming under water. A roaming mystery is where you travel some distance underwater. The key to a roaming mystery move at Fishbowl is to sink early and wing down to the subsurface Horseshoe current. This charc will push you towards the middle of the river, so when you resurface, focus immediately on getting back in the eddy. This is my favorite mystery spot on the Potomac, because it doesnt usually boss me around (except at higher levels) and the scenery is spectacular, perfect for a Mystery Circle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt lower levels, the wave/hole above the seam becomes better for surfing so you must defend the staging area or surface kayakers will cut right over the seam to get back in line. If it gets too busy, just head on down to Bermuda, because thats where the best downtime will be. Downtime is slang squirters use for time spent in the mystery move. Harris Haynie, Dave Collins, and I would often do these aerobic mystery sessions. This is how it works: After dipping in the first time, attain up to the top of the seam instead of paddling back into the eddy, and dip over and over until you need to rest. Wed often dip 8 to 10 times, occasionally dipping simultaneously one at the upstream part of the seam while the other is on the downstream portion of the seam. We first began going up to The FishBowl while looking for new places to play below 3.3 feet after the Fishladder waves in Portage were no longer good for surfing after the twin floods of 1995. We first started calling this spot The Shoe as an abbreviation on Horseshoe, the spectacular last drop of Great Falls on the Maryland side. The FishBowl seems more appropriate, cause the overlooks on both sides of the river can get quite crowded with tourist eager to check out the kayakers playing the river. \r\n\r\nAccess to the Potomac spots in my guide to Mather Gorge is from Great Fall National Park in Virginia, Great Falls and C&O Canal National Historic Park in Maryland, or Anglers Inn in Maryland.\r\nAccess Points:\r\n\r\nMaryland: Rt 189 to Macarther Blvb\r\n\r\n- Sandy Beach.

Look for a good-sized eddy in front of the rock that forms the point at the mouth of the Fishladder current on river left. Peel out of the staging eddy and head toward the upstream-most point of the convergence, theres a small curler at the optimum spot. As the river levels drop, the sweet spot moves downstream. Mysteries can be achieved either regular or back-cut, but the back-cut seems to work best. Often during the best mysteries youll travel underwater upstream a little when you use the back cut charc. On those really long mysteries, youll probably pop up just in time to make the eddy. At many levels, we often ferry across the river after re-entry to avoid being swept below the staging eddy and this also allows you to practice your mush moves. A little water pours out of the back of the eddy at higher levels. If you get flushed downstream, an amphibian over rock attainment is used to get back up to the staging eddy. The upstream fringes of Bermuda are toyed with at many higher levels, but beware and keep your up button ready to fire. I dont commit to a serious mystery charc until the levels are at or below 2.9. Extremely long and dangerous downtime can occur above 3.0 feet, there are many stories of scary downtime at and above this level.

This spot has a very quirky entry move, which must be performed approximately one boat width or so off the rock. The move most of the locals use is a backcut mystery charc. This charc involves paddling hard out of the eddy with your bow up. Once youve reach the spot next to and about boat width away from the rock, do a sudden forward weight throw to catch the bow under water. Then do fast rear pry on the right side, once your head is under, youll need to start spinning immediately or the currents will have their way with you. Extremely long, dark, and deep mysteries are possible here. Beware! This spot will draw you down quite deep very quickly. Ive experienced my longest and deepest mysteries here, many on the order of thirty seconds or more with depths over 10 feet deep. Ive heard of folks tapping rocks only occasionally. At the higher levels, water pours thru a slot next to the wall, this will affect your entrance charc. I prefer the lower levels of 2.7, when the slot is dry, because its an easier entrance charc and its also less turbulent once you get under.\r\n\r\nThis is another spot found in a Projet, I named it Simple Pleasures because the full potential was so difficult to achieve, yet so simple when you hit it. My preferred entry took more effort but gave consistent results - mush move not a true Mystery. As I recall there is a long seam leading into the sweet spot Stro describes, the key on the Mush is to enter the current high near the rock (that by now must have a name, named below I see) bow up high, as you enter the seam smash the bow down and about chest deep you should be near where a back cut charc would put you. After you drop a foot or so reverse the spin and enjoy the simple pleasures of life.\r\nOne of my favorite entrances to Simple Pleasures is without a boat. With a life jacket on leave the eddy, dip the up stream shoulder, catch the water on your back and sink. The wild thing here is that this will take you to the bottom - small boulder garden somewhat deep, plan on popping your ears on the way down - and keep you there, true roaming. The down draft is so strong that swimming with a life jacket you still have to push off to return to normal life.                                                                              mre.\r\n\r\nMost of the good mystery spots on the Potomac are on the river right, so most Potomac squirters are stronger at spinning underwater to the right. After a visit to the Ottawa Jimmicup, I vowed to practice my lefty moves. This venue is probably perfect for a regular lefty mystery charc, but our weakness probably led to the predominately used backcut charc.\r\n\r\n``For plastic boaters and intrepid (or unaware squirt boaters as has happened to yours truly as you can attest) watch out for this spot at 5 - 6 feet as the whirlpool will suck you way down and rattle your nerves and possibly try to drown you. I was sucked down, flipped over, rolled up and was still on my way down deep. Surfaced at the wall under your boat (whack).

At the right level its great vertical blow blastin and as you are smiling downstream allow your boat to work over to your right (VA) and then you and your boat will get sucked down, flatten out and come up down stream. It is really the way to get out of the blast. I think there is a name for this rock forming the pourover (Molly Hatchet).

This spot is suitable for slalom and rodeo boat mysteries. When Terrapin is going off, Tims Wave (old school Daves Wave? Most excellent wave moves!

Aptly named ‚ÄúSmoothie‚Äù by Carl Gittings in August of 1999, the spot has been frequented by local squirt boaters for years and has just recently begun to attract the attention of squirtists from further abroad.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to access the lower realms of Smoothie, but by far the best rides occur when the rider goes in ‚Äústandard‚Äù ‚Äì with the whirlpool energies.  The most popular entry seems to be to cross the eddyline just above the squeeze at about a 45 degree angle to the currents, and initiate your bow with a high-angle smash that snares the bow deep into the downstream currents close to the eddyline. Good timing is required, for as the boat spins with the momentum of the move and drifts down into the squeeze, you must simultaneously slam the stern down in and level the boat out, placing you about neck-deep and in perfect position to continue winging down, spinning along the seam and accessing ever-deepening realms.  This move is effective and flashy, and is an excellent way to get deep fast, avoiding the turbulence caused by the shallow water at the very top of the eddy.\r\n\r\nAnother common method is to approach the squeeze with your bow buried about a foot deep or so.  As you approach, you will notice a tiny curling wave that forms and disappears just above and to the eddy side of the squeeze ‚Äì the trick is to penetrate the currents just above this little wave and wing down hard with a decisive impact from your right hip (crossdraws work well here).  Be sure and get back into the eddy immediately, as the downstream currents will want to pull you out into the main flow.  Once you spin back in, it‚Äôs easy to continue winging down using the support of the eddy ‚Äì the experience is sublime, like floating down through thick layers of molasses.  There‚Äôs little sense of motion, even though your eyes are registering that the boat is spinning, the sensation of doing so is almost completely absent.\r\n\r\nThis spot can also be accessed using a backcut entry ‚Äì the drop is fast, and the downtime can be just as big as going regular.  There are those who have managed to make it work very well, with consistent huge rides in the 20-second-or-longer range. Approach the squeeze running very close to the eddyline, and watch for that same little curling wave.  The aim is to cut back perpendicular to the seam, effecting a big left-hip impact as you pass under that wave.  The drop is immediate if you‚Äôve positioned yourself properly‚Ä¶the trick now is to maintain your spin going against the whirlpool energies, not always an easy task.\r\n\r\nmore info:\r\nhttp://ottawajimicup.sinkspots.org/','','ft','14','epic','','2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400', '2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400'),

(see Susquehanna Surf Guide: http://www.chasingrain.com/surfguide/index.html)\r\n\r\nThere are multiple put-in and take-out locations available, but if you just want to get to Wunderland, the best put-in is on McCalls Ferry Road(River Rd on some maps), at the second creek which you cross over as you drive north from PA 372.  Hike down the creek bed to the river and ferry out to the pourovers.\r\n\r\nThe best spot is the river-left most eddyline.  Regular cut to the right or back-cut works, but you have to miss the ledge, to drop into the deep pool(very fast, but very smooth).  Once down, duration is up to you, and how well you can maintain your spin and balance.\r\n\r\nThe pourovers are also great for vertical blasting.\r\n\r\nThe eddy is not close to shore, and can be a little pushy, so you dont get too much rest between drops.  When youre pooped, go downstream to Playspot II and then takeout at the next access point along the road.  You can do multiple laps if you need to. \r\n\r\nThe levels are only suggestions, since the flow is dependent on how water is being distributed from the dam, which changes sporadically.\r\n\r\nby Dan Mayer','01570500','ft','15','moderate','','2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400', '2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400'),

There is a 25 ft replica of the statue of liberty atop a crumbling stone bridge pier in the middle of the river (visible from 322).  Apparently, Paul Schreiner helped in the construction of the original statue, which was replaced after a flood or something.\r\n\r\nYou can see the spot from route 11/15 which is on River Right (West Shore).  Head north out of Marysville and pull off just before the road narrows and the stone guard wall begins.  Look about 50 yards off the shore for a tell-tale pourover curling off a sloped rock with a huge eddy behind it.  Unfortunately, you cant put in there because youre separated from the river by a 100 ft near-vertical embankment, and a 6-lane rail-bed, which gets a lot of traffic.\r\n\r\nThe best access is from downstream in Marysville.  Find the tunnel which goes under the railroad tracks to the river.  Turn left as you exit the tunnel, and drive to the end of the road.  There is a small pull-off to the right where you can park.  \r\nYou can paddle up from here but its much easier to hike (about a quarter mile) along the tracks.  Bring sturdy shoes or booties for the hike.  The shore is a poison ivy plantation, so wear pants and long sleeves.  Put in high, above almost all of the rapids, and drift down to the spot.\r\n\r\nThe seam is a pourover on River Left side of the rock.  It tends to take you straight down very quickly to a depth where things mellow out and you can begin spinning.  Its pretty shallow, and youre likely to tap some rocks - nothing hazardous though. The eddy is big enough for multiple boats, but its 50 yds from shore, so taking a break can be a challenge.\r\n\r\nThe spot is formed by a pourover slipping a layer of water under a large, overhanging slab of eddy current.  You can feel the eddy slab as you slam into it, or slip under it.  When you slam into it, you typically will start surfacing in a bubbly layer.  If you get under it, youll be in darker greenwater and two things can happen.  You travel under and pop up on the other side of the eddy, in the main slab.  Or you stall under the eddy slab and get pasted to the bottom.  You will come up, but its very slow, and it feels like youre under tremendous weight.\r\n\r\nThe ease of entry and variety of rides you can get here make this spot really fun.\r\n\r\nBy Dan Mayer','01570500','ft','','moderate','','2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400', '2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400'),

You can see the convergence as the water falls over the submerged ledge off the tip of the island. The squeeze is about 25 ft deep at low tide. This is an incoming tide sink spot.

Definitely check the charts before driving up to make sure the its running at a reasonable time of day.\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS:\r\nTake Route 1 north through Bath and over the Kennebec river bridge. Immediately after reaching the East shore, take a right onto 127, just before the Dairy Queen, following signs to Georgetown and Arrowsic Islands. Soon after that right, youll go over another bridge. Youll be on Arrowsic Island. Keep following 127 for 5 or so (maybe a few more) miles until you come to another bridge. This is the bridge connecting Arrowsic Island to Georgetown Island. The Singing Eddy is right below you coming off the tip of the island. Park either before or after the bridge and pick your way down to shore. The seam is obvious and Ryan always seems to backcut it with great success.\r\n\r\nmap of the area:\r\nhttp://www.bobfenton.com/georgetown.maine.area.htm\r\n\r\npay camping on georgetown island:\r\nhttp://www.sagbaycamping.com/location.html','n/a(tidal)','cfs','','epic','','2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400', '2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400'),

(if you are up to it, you can also run the rapid) then play at the bottom while you wait for the rest of your group to portage. :>)\r\n\r\n2) Center of the river at bottom of Lunch Hole. Nice beach on river right and you can access this spot from the road on River left. Parking may be a challenge though, so you may have to walk from an appropriate pull out. Ill get mileage marker info next time I am there.\r\nSpot is formed off of the back of the last hole which at this level was more of a pourover. Trust the downstream thrust and you will avoid the rocks that form the ledge. Ride the slab down - DEEP. I was in a full float PFD and my bigfoot and was able to completely disappear for a couple of seconds each time. Would be really fun to roam without PFD! Super deep pool behind the line with other eddy lines to explore.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Just guessing on the max - min - ideal flow levels.

The eddy current curls around and collects against the bottom edge of the dry portion of the dam, which feeds current back into the slab at right angles to the main flow, creating a strong looking squeeze.  I dont, however, see a drop in the river bottom to create the down-draft.\r\n\r\nAccess to this spot is terrible, and involves either a long upstream paddle, a short trespass on a nuclear energy facility, or a long flatwater lake crossing followed by a short trespass on the power companys dam.

The area is also known as York Haven, the name of the town on the West shore, and the name of the dam and power station.  On topo maps, its called Conewago Falls, since Conewago Creek enters from the East at this point.\r\n\r\nThe fun spots are clustered near river right, under the upstream-most set of high voltage wires that cross the river.  There is a convergence on river right, where a slab of current joins the main flow after a long trip around an island and over some ledges.  The last ledge forms a fun but shallow hole, where you can catch a surf before heading down the slab into the seam.  This spot only works from 4.5-4.7 ft.  3-4 second helmet mysteries thus far.\r\n\r\n50 yards to river left is a dunking rock with a sloping edge that will give up a short helmet deep dunk with a light stern tap.

The flow splits around the top island, and when it comes back together it forms a big squeeze Ill tentatively call Bermuda South. The river left channel is pinched by some 45 degree rock layers that extend from the left shore, forming a new river gorge-ish wave train that runs about 100 feet. On the river left side of this train is a huge eddy the size of a baseball infield with counterclockwise return service back to the top of the wave train. This swirl takes you along the top of the lower island. The lower end of the upper island has a nice place to empty the boat and take breaks/stash packs/safety break, or just do it from the cobble-y beach by the tracks.  \r\n\r\nCharcs: \r\nI knew I had found the goods when my very first drop gave up a 3 second helmet under ride even with my life jacket on... \r\nYou can tap the RR side of the wave train for a good dunk anywhere from the root at the top of the eddy to 20 feet down the eddy line. The eddy here had some good upstream momentum along with small whirlpools and big boils. The RL side of the wave train also has many entry charcs to try. Going under at the first wave you will clip a rock, 2nd wave on down is deep and clean.  3rd and 4th waves are worth attempting too, at 3000 cfs they seemed to form the strongest squeezes on this side. As your wave train ride plays out you can either take the conveyer belt left and back to the top or move back to river right and mush into Bermuda South, hopefully getting a no travel ride. The squeeze here extends below the point of no return dropping into the next rapid and past the safety of the big eddy back to river left. Helmet under rides are possible at all 3 spots. \r\nI also got a couple good neck deep with PFD rides below the bottom island but the convergence is not nearly as strong. There is a small eddy to get back up but its not nearly as effortless or grandiose as the top arena. \r\n\r\nAccess: \r\nFrom Exit 168 on I-81 head east on route 614 then go @ 3 miles. When you cross the bridge over the James park at a public access point on your right. There is a very tempting ATV trail near the river that goes up the river right bank, but on the way home I talked to a local that lives up the road and he said the unfriendly landowner usually carries a shotgun on his ATV... Besides by the time the ATV trail is even with the 2 islands you are in sight of a house AND have to bushwack a tenth of a mile through poisin ivy and stinging nettles. That leaves the railroad track on river left, which is a good 30-40 feet below the bridge, didnt scout out a descent. Its much easier to spot the islands from this side of the river. The next putin upstream is only about 4 miles away at Buchanan, maybe theres more goods along the way? \r\n\r\nExtras: \r\nAt this level the train has 2 surfable waves at the top, didnt do much for me in my ninja but kept my buddy in plastic entertained (wave was ideal for a 7-9 foot boat, 6 ft spuds so-so). Most of yall with cruiser bottoms can mix it up with a little surfing up top, maybe some clues? \r\nThe top island had several flat spots that would be ideal for camping, but Id take a machete to clear out some PI and SN...

Paddlers travel from all over the world to experience this phenomena. The Skookumchuck Tidal Rapid forms when the tide rises in the ocean, and accelerates as it is constricted through the channel leading into a large fjord area. During the tides, approximately 200 billion gallons of water jets through the narrow channel at speeds of 10-17 knots during flood tides. It is an amazing site to see, even if you werent going to kayak. Skookumchuck means Strong Water, and this area will not disappoint. \r\n\r\nBesides the wave that is sick to surf in a old Rave or other long glass boat... there are giant ass whirlpools that i would be afraid to get into, perhaps dishing out terminal/oblivian mysteries. Not suggesting you drop in them in your slinky destination boat at max flood tide! BUT, i would guess at the correct (smaller side) levels, you could get quality and controlled world class mysteries, just like Singing Eddy or some other tidal spot..\r\n\r\nTo get to the Skook is quite an ordeal. First, you must get into Canada, easier for some than others. Usually the Canadians are cool, but are suspicious of kayakers, so most of the time you get stopped and inspected at the Border. Once in Canada, you need to get to Highway 1, and to Horseshoe Bay Ferry Terminal, about 20 minutes outside of Vancouver, BC. The ferry to get on is the one to Langdale, and it runs roughly every two hours (BC Ferries Schedule). The ferry is quite nice, but quite expensive, so planning ahead and carpooling up is essential (BC Ferries Fare Schedule). Keep in mind that your car will probably be charged Overheight because of the kayaks, nearly doubling the cost of crossing. Note though, that you dont need to pay for the ferry on the way back. \r\n\r\nferry schedule: http://www.bcferries.bc.ca/schedules/mainland/vasc-current.html\r\n\r\nferry fares: http://www.bcferries.bc.ca/schedules/mainland/vasc-current.html\r\n\r\nOnce on the Ferry, its a smooth 45 minutes to Langdale. From Langdale, its another 1:20 to the tiny town of Egmont, the small town that is only known for its access to Skook. From the town, you can either put in at the Marina and paddle in, or hike in on the popular trail. More than 60,000 people per year hike the 2.5km in to see the tidal rapid.\r\n\r\n If you look at a tide chart or calculator, there are a few things to look for to understand the rapid, and when it will be flowing. On the chart, there is a max flood, max ebb, and slack. The max flood is the fastest the rapid will run during a tide, and is what is important. Optimal surfing flows occur between 12-14 knots. The other thing that is important to remember is that the flow begins two hours before max flood, and lasts two hours after. A max flood at 9pm is great, except the last 2 hours will be in the dark. You also need to figure in a 45 minute hike/ paddle out.\r\n\r\ntide calculator: http://tbone.biol.sc.edu/tide/tideshow.cgi?site=Sechelt+Rapids%2C+British+Columbia+Current+(use+with+caution)','','cfs','','epic','','2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400', '2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400'),

There is one drop which is larger than the others (the breaker), followed by a pleasant pool, and the possibility of a take-out. Otherwise you can continue on down. Keep your wits about you for this final 100m, as there are some more drops. Take out before the road bridge.

The strait is one of the connections between the Pacific Ocean and the Inland Sea, a body of water separating Honsh&#363, and Shikoku, two of the main islands of Japan. The tide moves large amounts of water into the Inland Sea twice per day, and also removes large amounts of water twice a day. With a range of up to 1.7 m, the tide creates a difference in the water level of up to 1.5 m between the Inland Sea and the Pacific. Due to the narrowness of the strait, the water rushes through the Naruto channel at a speed of about 13-15 km/h four times per day, twice flowing in and twice flowing out. During a spring tide, the speed of the water may reach 20 km/h, creating vortices up to 20 m in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe current in the strait is the fastest in Japan and the fourth fastest in the world after the Saltstraumen outside Bod√∏ in Norway, which reaches speeds of 37 km/h, the Moskstraumen off the Lofoten islands in Norway (the original maelstrom), which reaches speeds of 27.8 km/h, and the Old Sow whirlpool in New Brunswick, Canada, which has been measured with a speed of up to 27.6 km/h.\r\n\r\nThe whirlpools can be observed from ships, or from the Naruto Bridge spanning the strait.

We pushed off from shore with some skepticism as to what we would find.  Low and behold we get 200 feet downstream and find the only bonafide lefty spot on the Po!!.

Stro is the one who told me about this spot.  He told me that back in the day, him and some other old-schoolers would hit this spot up at times with respectable downtime in the whirlpools.  After, being pleasantly surprised at Right There John and I headed on down to see what this spot would give down.  We were not disappointed!  Using a backcut charc we were getting consistent head under rides.  I also had 3 rides in the 15 to 20 second range with close to 100 feet of travel.  It was bordering on epic for a short span, but then things just went dry.  We only had about an hour here before John and I headed back.  After this I headed up to check out Afternoon Delight at this lower level, while John Headed to Brookmont Dam for some surfing.  Afternoon Delight was surprisingly OK at this lower level, but I was really anxious to give Po Dunk another shot.  I paddled down and was just about completely skunked.  The water had dropped a little bit which may have been the reason for no downtime or I was just worn out.  Anyway, the jury is still out on this spot, but the potential is there for a great new Realm!  \r\n\r\nThe Verdict is in: This spot is awesome!!\r\n\r\nDirections:  You can just paddle down to this spot from Anglers.  However, the best access is from the hike in from Marsden Track.  There is a pull off about 200 feet upstream from the Stop sign at Brickyard Road on MacArthur Blvd.  Park and hike to the river from here.  During your hike will come to a bridge at the Canal.  Go over the bridge and make a right onto the towpath and then an immediate left back onto the path.  The path leads down to a T. There is a good launch spot right here--make a left at the T go ten feet and there is a path down to the river.  Once here you will see an island directly across from you and another island farther out.  You can attain up the channel between these two islands without much difficulty--once at the top of the channel ferry across to river right--get high enough to make it around the far island.  Actually, we have found the attainment easier on the back side of the second island.\r\n\r\nYou will see a rock that forms a large eddy in the middle of the channel.  The flow that comes off the river left side this rock is forms the squeeze.  You can pretty much enter anyway with regular righties--the rock does stick out quite a ways so I have been getting a foot away from the rock before initiating, however for a good drop you want to be as close to the rock as possible without hitting it.  The flow on the left side of the rock also gives up respectable downtime above 3.45.  Finally, the flow coming into the channel from the island is also fun to play with--I am still wondering if you can link up a ride from this top flow into squeeze off the eddy rock.  There is not much traffic at this Realm. I would say it is a great place to practice Safety\r\n\r\nHappy Roaming!\r\n\r\n6/16/12\r\nI  took the ? mark off the min and max reading so that it would report as in when its in.\r\nStro','01646500','ft','','epic','','2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400', '2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400'),

The water was still low at 3:30pm when we put on. Wilbur Dam was scheduled to begin its release at 1pm. We were skeptical about putting on cause we didnt want to paddle the shoals at low water and risk bustin up the boats. But we decided to put our faith in the TVA and get in anyway. We had paddled to behind the sycamore shoals state park near the end of the parks walking trail where the river forks around an island. The river left fork is the deeper channel and the route we decided to take. I had paddled this section of the river before in a long plastic boat at 0 generators with my girlfriend and remembered this section being really shallow and difficult to navigate. But today at 4pm the channel was obvious and smooth. (The water must be rising!) I aimed river right for an eddy created by the downstream tip of the island and Ryan turned in right behind me. When we spun around to look downstream we knew we had found what we were looking for. Water currents from both sides of the island were colliding with one another in a pleated smash that stretched out for at least 30 feet right in front of us. After I got over the initial shock of having found such potential 10 minutes from where I lived and had spent most of my life I decided to drop in. When I hit the seam it pulled me down hard. Once I got underwater, I was off like a prom dress. Even with my eyes closed I could tell I was moving fast. I just knew I was going to slam into a big rock or log or fish or something. But I never did. I just kept skipping off the river bottom until I ran out of air. I really had to fight to get back up before I got blown past the eddy. When I surfaced I found the eddy, threw up some really hard fist pumps, and then immediately began the ferry back up the river right bank for another ride. We stayed here way too long. Ryan was supposed to meet his inlaws for dinner at 6pm. So at about ten til six we decided to take out early and call his wife from sammons hot dogs to come pick us up.\r\n\r\nBest place to park is at the Sycamore Shoals State Park. Parking is free.

Mysteries above 11.6 can get very dynamic, and even from 11 to 11.6, the rides can be loopy even when you\\re in the black compression zone.  I have played around there in the 13\\s but stayed away from the main squeeze.  The highest that locals have tapped in was 12.6 feet, during a river run, with PFDs and paddles, which dished out some nerve-wracking rides.\r\n\r\nSpin Cycle is pretty epic because very deep rides can be had here.  There have been a few over 20 seconds but the up button was pushed.  All of the rides here are different. \r\nThe river constricts here to form the seam, and the result is a strong fold complete with lots of whirlpools.  The whirlpools turn in both directions and go deep.  The current here is also kind surging, so eddy walls form and also go deep where they can smack into you, causing a stall, slide, or a loop or two.  The key is to get under quickly and kung fu your way down through the first few feet of turbulence and level off.  You may need to brace off of those eddy walls and whirlpools once deep.  Sometimes it\\s smooth and easy and sometimes it\\s not.   Spin Cycle may suck out your earplugs or your ride might be super mellow and smooth with great subaquatic visuals.\r\n\r\nAnother reason that this is a pretty epic spot is based on two things:  1) the underwater terrain may be, according to old folklore, scattered with some debris.  I have heard that there are things like bicycles and an old tractor in there.  There definitely is a rock that is about 3 to 4 feet off of the tip of the rock cliff on the river right side, but no one has ever hit it or maybe even come close, and several rides have ended up past the cliff.  As a matter of fact, no one has ever hit anything here and rides have been deep and dark.  Which brings us to 2), when your charc is right, the seam will take you very deep and it gets pitch black.  You roam for several spins and you are lost.  This gets scary, there\\s no doubt about it.  \r\n\r\nYou can park n sink here by parking by the dam and walking 250 to 300 yards down the path to the spot, or you can run a class III/III+ rapid down to the seam, and walk back up.  Or you can just run the whole river, it\\s a great squirt run.\r\nThere is also another epic seam downriver called Tree Hugger, and a few quick mushes and waveholes to ride along the way.\r\nBeer and food at both take out and put in.\r\nGauge Phone # 845.658.8180','','ft','','epic','','2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400', '2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400'),

There is no park and play here, you have to run some class 2, and then after your session, you will have to run (walk if need be) about a mile of class 3 and 4 afterwards.\r\nTree Hugger is formed by an elbow in the river where there is an eddyline that is formed by the rocks on the bank combined with a drop in the riverbed.  Basically, squirtboaters drop into a trough in the riverbed along the bank.  There have been recent changes to the riverbed here from Hurricane Irene, which gives us a second eddyline that comes from the other riverbank and traverses the main flow to meet up with eddyline #1.\r\nThe rides here can be smooth and very deep with a delay on the up button, judging from years past.  In 2007 or 2008 a flood jammed some trees into the core of the seam and ruined it.  Tree Hugger used to kick down massive downtime, and the recent changes seem to have only improved the power of the eddyline.  \r\nAs of December 2011, we have yet to hit it above 11.2 because the level hasn\\\\t been there when we can go.  But judging on tapping in at lower levels, I can tell that the spot will be as good if not better than it used to be before the hurricane.\r\nI have gotten some rides around 6 or 8 seconds here below 11 feet but the second eddyline tends to smack you into the rock wall which kind of sucks.\r\nThere is a two-stage eddy service here.  The on-deck eddy has plenty of space but the batter-up eddy can fit 2, maybe 3 boats.  The massive tree that used to lay in the heart of the squeeze is in that eddy, and paddlers must hug the tree to keep from getting sucked out by the current.

If you hit it up during the baseball season you should be able to listen to the game while you sink!\r\n\r\nTo reach the spot park at Granby park.  Hike upstream about 1/8th of a mile to the blossom street bridge.  There are some rough trails through the woods that will get you there which will require walking across a few large diameter water pipes.  Put-in in the pool beside the bridge pylon and paddle to the upstream side of the pylon and drop in on the other side.  \r\nTake-out.  When you are done just paddle downstream the 1/8 of a mile you walked to a small cement boat launch on river left.

Discovered by Noah, its a beautiful convergence below and island which drops into a deep pool.  You can camp right there.  It goes great in both directions of spin and often has crystal clear water so you can watch the sand/gravel bar below you.  At good levels (800-1,100), 20 - 30 second rides are common.  The water is often really clear, so lots of gravel/rocks/sticks to see with goggles....nothing to worry about hitting though :)  \r\n\r\nTo get there, Take the Hirschdale Exit off I-80 west from Reno (Or east from truckee).  Turn right off the ramp onto Hirschdale Rd (downstream).  After a few hundred meters, bear left onto Hirschdale Rd.  Cross the river and stay on the dirt road, looking for a right turn onto a smaller dirt road down hill to the right, which is just at the very end of a long chain link fence on the right--If you get to the end of Hirschdale Rd, you went too far....just turn around and take the 1st left back downhill--  Cross the RR tracks and drive down the road to near-river height, looking for a sharp turn to the right, which goes down a steep small hill (non trucks should park across from this turn).  Drive or walk down the hill to the river and the seam is just below the small island.  \r\n\r\nENJOY!!!!!','10346000','cfs','','epic','','2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400', '2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400'),

This is the last plug of water that empties into Indian Pool, but take a look at the next few spots above, sometimes they can give up rides too but need to catch the eddy quickly.  The charc here is tricky.  You have to paddle all the way up the diagonal ledge, and drop in parallel to the ledge/trough with a lefty charc.  I try to be under right when my bow gets to the obvious fold.  You WILL smack the rock here with your bow until you get it dialed.  Smack away, unlike the Bubbler the rock here is smooth and not pinnable.  I try to stay as flat as possible and only take a small bite out of the plug.  If you get both ends under and have a bit of leftward momentum it will carry you almost immediately over a second ledge for a double suck.  The second ledge is underwater and usually not visible, and I think it is also about 30 degrees left of the set up ledge.  The best rides are when you miss the rock by inches and get slammed down perfectly parallel to the 2nd ledge, but you can still get sent with some rock taps.  The rides go from 0 to 60, getting sent plugs you right into the last wave train entering the pool.  Best control comes from being right on the eddyline, half in half out.      \r\n\r\nIf you live in Virginia you know exactly where this spot is.  Out of towners:  From I-81 take exit 195.

Journaled here for help with future trip planning for one lucky permit lottery winner.  First come, first serve permits also available outside peak season.  Before will be snowy, high water, maybe Marsh Creek put in.  After will be ELF run, but great fishing and chucker grouse hunting seasons.  Local guides say you can still get a raft down from Boundary Creek at 1.7.  On an oar rig with the sleds strapped for Park and Play is the way to go.  Downriver would shred your boat, too many rapids with fresh angular granite in shallow water.  Taking a boat with a soft hull would be ideal, it would open up a lot more spots for sessioning.  Lots of drop zones with leaky eddies, so a mad dash a la Bermuda Triangle is necessary after your ride plays out.  Following is my recollection of the most prominent spots I observed during a trip in July 2015 at the level of about 2 feet or 850 cfs.  ---MP 12.5, Sheepeater Island.  Looks like 2 big slabs squeezing into each other at a 60 degree angle.  River right channel, bouncing off a RR wall and the island.  Reminded me of Swallow Cliffs.  Excellent Hot springs downstream at mp 13.   ---MP 32.7, Marble Right Camp.  Current bends to the right, falling off cobble bar and going deep next to a wall on river left.  Nice recirculation in eddy squeezes back in, big boils and long recovery pool.  Just down stream at ---MP 33.0. Ski Jump Rapid.  Ski Jump Rock came out at low water, sloped rock drops into deep long pool.  Looked like Fascination Alley on river left.  Best looking spot on the river at 2 feet.  ---MP 43.6, Pine Flat Rapid Ender Spot.  Massive Fucking downtime.  If there aren\\t any rocks in outflow, this one will be epic.  Huge whirlpools, massive slab drop.  MP 51.1 Underwater Canyon.  Explore at own risk, def worth a stop, swim and fish.  ---MP 58, Tappan Rapids.  Great looking eddylines, drops, and whirlpools this whole 2 mile stretch. Could probably downriver this small section.  ---MP 70.5 Earthquake Rock.  Great wave surfing.  You are bringing a 7.5 foot slicey plastic boat too right?  ---MP 79-95, Impassable Canyon.  The best eddylines on this river are when the walls pinch in and the river gets deep.  That describes this last long section.  Post up if you see a spot, once you go past it the MF lives up to its name River Of No Return.  Any climbers in your group will get fired up about the walls.  2 30 foot slings and a top rope could get you on a lot of rock, watch out for snakes in the scree.

It is a super cool place to run some fun falls and drop a world class sink spot in one trip.  Park in the park just below the falls, and paddle up (it is a fairly long flatwater padde, so I may take a playboat or creek boat next time and tow my squirt up).  So far, I have only explored it for 2 days and just the seams up the river left channel.  The main one that I have played from 4,000-6,000 was in the outflow of the falls just upstream of the crack drop  Basically paddle as far up the river left channel as you can, and you will find it no problem.

The eddy feeds back into the flow and you can see some nice whirlpools down the eddy line. There is excellent eddy service and amazing beach for loading/unloading between sets. \r\n\r\nYou can spin right or left (backcut). There are several different types of rides you can take. I have had a few rides where I have gone deep and come up precisely where I dropped. These were very promising! Most rides though have been traveling ones. The drop is excellent and the accomplished squirt boater should have a very high success rate. The channel seems to be around 10-12√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ deep. \r\n\r\nThere are two rocks in the eddy downstream of the drop, but I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tangled with them yet. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s still something to be aware of, and you can see them when you are sitting in the eddy. I think they are pretty benign. \r\n\r\nThe name is a product of the fact that the water is frigid, a result of the snowmelt from the Sawtooth mountains on the SF Payette and the dam release out of the bottom of the Deadwood River (colder than the SF). However, the temperatures are routinely 100 degrees and the water is crystal clear. Very refreshing! There is excellent camping, and a beautiful beach. Also, most people get cell service here. \r\n\r\nNot too sure yet about the high and low level limits, but the Deadwood release ends at Labor Day and it won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be in at that time. \r\n\r\nTo get here drive from Banks, ID up the SF Payette on the Banks-Lowman Highway approximately 12 miles (through Garden Valley) to the Alder Creek Bridge on the right. Cross the bridge over the SF (takeout for the Swirly Canyon) and then take the first left. Cross the little one lane bridge over Alder Creek (nearly dry during summer) and then look immediately for the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìSF Payette Recreation Area√¢‚Ç¨¬ù sign on the left. This is the site of excellent camping. Walk from the campsites down to the beach. The beach can be a popular spot for swimming and fishing during the summer. There are some good cliff jumps just downstream of the dropzone. \r\n\r\nYou may also see some fish while here. We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve seen several very large ones (possibly Salmon). Just downstream there was a herd of young elk in the river and an Osprey carrying a fish.

Folks have already knocked off 30+ second rides here, and rumors abound about massive potential. \r\n\r\nThere is a rock that you may sometimes tag on rides that involve big downstream travel, but the shape seems friendly on a low-water inspection and it has been harmless to date.\r\n\r\nIn the adapted words of Mr. Sibley: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Clear Water, natural Flow, 1/2 champagne, 1/2 laminar, epic water fall, 60 second potential.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \r\n\r\nA great spot that warrants further exploration.','02399200','cfs','','epic','','2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400', '2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400'),

Lots of travel, no stalling at all at last nights level, but it is a nice smooth drop with good support from flow filling the adjacent eddy. However, unlike Mellow Ledge, there is a great setup/rest eddy right by the rock (which is a perfect observation rock) and one of the best views of the bridge you can get. For easy access you can set a vehicle at Teays takeout and put on above or below Fayette Station rapid.\r\nI\\\\m guessing best levels will be 2.5\\\\-3.5\\\\ (maybe higher if you can still make the approach move).

Some really funky localized rain patterns made it really difficuly to get a grip on what was going on with the gauge.  After doing some research the past couple of weeks though things are starting to clear up, allowing us to get some some solid beta on levels.  It appears that the online gauge is still pretty close to what pre-software change levels were.  However, the phone gauge appears to be .12 higher pretty consistently--atleast at the Bermuda levels.

First off the phone is still off.  Subtract .12 from the phone reading to get the actual gauge reading--this pretty much works for any level.  We held the eddyline squirt comp at Bermuda this past weekend and there were several rides, myself included where the up-button did not want to work.  Today, about .05 lower which is about 250 less cfs, I still got jostled around a little with the stick.  However, the hand-paddle rides were smooth and there were no up button malfunctions.  The spring also seems to have deposited some rock in the upstream eddy that is only about 4 feet deep--I have tapped it on quite a few rides going upstream but it is friendly as far as rocks go.  Finally, it looks like the level will be good pretty far down this year as it looks as if the flow coming out of the Fishladder is more concentrated toward the upstream end.  Last year it was somewhat split in two making the seam pretty weak around 2.8 and below.

Attainers right clue:  steep charc hip switch about 6 feet right of the rock to avoid scraping on entry (go for the flow, not the eddyline).  Watch your left blade dragging on the rock on entry, it has an appetite for jimistyxs.  Definitely worth a 1-2 hour drive, but when paired with a run upstream through the ultra-classic goshen pass (class 3-4)  a longer drive could be justified.

The main flow piles up on a large rock and falls off to the right side.  This flow meets with the flow heading from center right to left and makes a squeeze of sorts.  \r\n\r\nThe main problem with the spot is the inconsistent and turbulent eddy line.  The eddy boils and surges as you are moving up stream to charc in.  This boiling eddy is the reason for the spots inconsistency.  Other than that it is as good a spot as any.  \r\n\r\nThe charc is a traditional lefty right beside the rock.  I try and get as much of my boat up and into the slab as possible before I initiate.  The charc is hard and aggressive but when you hit it right it will send your ass to the bottom of the river.\r\n\r\nThe initial drop takes you down 5 or 6 feet.  If you manage to hold on through this initial drop you will find yourself falling off a shelf that takes you down to the 8-10 foot range.  Depending on the ride you will sometimes drop 4-5 feet more.  These rides are dynamic!  Sometimes you will stay in the big eddy on river left and sometimes you will traverse across the river ending up on river right in the big right eddy (coast to coast rides).

Sometimes mysteries are smooth and some are a bit dynamic.  If you can kung fu your way down through the top turbulent layers, you can get rewarded with some nice roaming.  Even when in the compression layer, you can be slapped with a surge which may cause you to skid, stall, black attack, or loop.  But if you work it right, you can fight your way through a surge and keep your boat level for a longer ride.   \r\nSo, that said, Spin Cycle is still pretty sweet despite the record floods.',0,'2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400', '2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400'),

    (97,63,'Sweet Cheeks WV','josh','2011-09-16',2800,'','10','MY TRIP:\r\nDuring Gauleyfest weekend 2011 I spent a total of 4 days sessioning this spot.  Friday I hiked a Ninja in down the trail at Carnifex Ferry State Park, and put in below Pillow.  Had a great first day getting used to the spot.  Stashed my boat on river left in the woods then swam across the river and hiked back up.  Saturday I ran the upper in plastic, stopped and switched boats, and had another 3 sessions before continuing downstream.  Sunday I hiked into Pillow, swam across the river, 4 more sessions.  Then I floated down a few more rapids to the top of Lost Paddle and got out river RIGHT and hiked out.  Monday I ran downstream in my Jet and had another great session with Maverick before hiking out to Carnifex again.  By stashing a boat for several days I was really able to dial in the spot and spend all my energy there without worrying about getting too exhausted before lost paddle. \r\nNEW ACCESS BETA:\r\n A few hundred yards above the confluence with the Meadow and the top of Lost Paddle find a beach on river RIGHT (big enough to park 4 rafts, and surrounded by rippled blocks 6-8 feet high).  Walk downstream until the beach turns into a trail and take 2 rights up into the woods.  Here you find a wide trail that ascends back to the Carnifex Ferry SP.  This hike out takes 30 minutes and is very enjoyable!  Because it follows the old horse and wagon trail from days when the ferry was the only way across, it never gets steeper than 10 degrees.  Much better than trying to he man up the pillow rock trail.  By the way, if you DO decide to hike out at pillow, make sure to put in at the pool ABOVE sweet cheeks to ferry back over.  Word is that river right bank next to SC is all jungled out with huge rocks that are a pain in the ass to portage over.  Hit the pool above and it\\\\s a quick bit of clear rock hopping upstream to the trail.  Going downstream to the Carnifex Ferry trail is much gentler on the body overall.  PS history buffs:  you can find old stone bunkers from the Civil War Battle in the woods above the trail.  Imagine being a soldier shooting at the enemy from behind your pile of rocks...  When the trail takes a sharp left, following a side creek and the river noise goes away, don\\\\t worry you\\\\re still on the right path.  Sweet Cheeks has a high price of admission:  You either run Insignificant and Pillow or  you have to gut it out and walk down the STEEP pillow rock trail.  But it\\\\s worth it!  For those who aren\\\\t up for running downstream in a park and sink boat, the hike in is well worth it, especially if you can stash it a few days.  To drive to Carnifex Ferry continue south on 129 past the summersville dam a couple miles.  When the road takes a 90 degree right at Kessler Cross Lanes, take a left onto Carnifex Ferry Road? until the road ends and the park.  The trail down to Pillow rock starts left of the overlook, and the trail up from the ferry comes out behind the shelters to the right.  \r\n  CHARCS:  \r\n  At 2800 it\\\\s perfect.  Attainer\\\\s right is an eddy with return service.  From the eddy you surf a little wave 20 feet left.  As I surf over, I try to get high on the wave so as it ends I am charging down the face with extra upstream momentum.  Crossing another 10 feet of fast current takes you to the seam.  This is where having a stick comes in handy, 4 quick strokes gets me a lot higher on the seam than handpaddlers.  I was going left, initiating into the river right current, which goes under the river left current.  I was chopping in with a big stern pry on my left and then keeping it extended in a stiff arm and having great results.  Most everybody else goes righty and backcut here though.  Underwater it is smooth as butter once you\\\\re down.  20 seconds every time for dialed in sinkers.  The real surprise was on Monday when I was nailing 5-15 second rides in my Jet!  This was my starter boat and is cut HIGH and has puffed up volume around the toes.  First I put a 20 pound rock in my lap as ballast, but then I was getting rides without it too!  Of all the spots in WV I\\\\ve tried to sink that thing, this is probably the easiest to get a bigger boat DOWN.  We\\\\re talking Twisted Sister style easy entry without the scare factor.  \r\n   At 3200 it starts to wash out.  The seam is still right there but the wave is starting to disappear and the last 10 feet of current is FAST.  Handpaddlers and LOW boats don\\\\t bother.  Big boats and sticks could probably get good rides, but the current is starting to intrude into the eddy and you really have to fight to get back upstream.  \r\n  At 2000 it gets a lot weaker, and the most powerful part of the squeeze seems to move downstream.  Also entry wave is not as perfectly formed so it is difficult to keep upstream position on the ferry out.  The underwater rock on river right is starting to become visible, it is 45 degrees to the current and it becomes clear to the observer why there is such a strong current dropping off there.  \r\n    HEARSAY:\r\n  Steve O said one old schooler who loved the spot said the BEST level was 1500.  Maybe team Fayettenam will do some exploring next summer?  Ricky said Chuck Kern used to charc in, drop his paddle and get 30 seconds, coming up left at the very bottom of the eddy.  J Pou was told by somebody if you start getting really long and deep rides, watch out for a couple rocks 15-20 seconds in.  You may bump against 2 for a second, but don\\\\t worry, just hang out and you will go up and over them.  You CAN go lefty!  On river right above the spot, there is a really nice surf wave, all day glassy carving.  When you are ready to take a break from sinking, put in at the pool above, and ferry over for a nice surf.  From the spot you can look upstream and see rafts getting flipped on Volkswagen Rock.  If you are going downstream with other non-sinkers, you can usually convince them to watch carnage at Pillow for a bit while you get a session in.  It is also great fun to get rides underneath your friends in plastic who may have not seen mysteries before.  ',0,'2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400', '2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400'),

One at the top of the channel, one at the deltoid rock and one at the very bottom of the channel.  At the 750 level, nothing was happening at the top or deltoid rock.  But, at the bottom, there was a little downtime to be had.   At the lower part of the channel, the water drops off a shoal and there is a down stream flow plus a flow off the river left bank.

Amazing setting, classic structure of 2 huge slabs running into each other.  Like the Y in Tennessee but way more power.  Chop in however you want.  If it\\\\s on the seam near the top you\\\\re going down.  I have never seen such well formed whirlpool structures, big ones shear off at the top and can be seen extending 10 feet down.  If you drop high and fast, you can hover at the bottom of the river with hardly any travel.  Blue angel rides are out, you can resurface anywhere.  Chop in the river left slab and you can stall easier on the sloping rubble bar of tumbled granite.  Pretty turbulent  deep and high on the seam but as you roam downstream it smoothes out and keeps taking you deeper until you hover just a couple feet off the bottom.   Probably 15 feet deep?   I was pushing the up button on half of my rides.  I almost went back to the car  a couple times to get my PFD, it took about 5 seconds to resurface after you pushed the up button!  Before this trip I was all set to chop my boat this winter, now I do not think I will.  XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.  THE SCENE--  the spot is right next to a massive cobble and sand beach.  No shade or trees for hammocks. Pretty friendly for any visitors bringing family with small children.  Except for crossing the road the trail to the river is not steep.  There is a wide area of shallow water, the seam is about 50 feet away from the beach.  On weekends there is a constant stream of Massachusetts finest collections of rednecks, coeds, raft customers, drinkers, smokers, tubers, kayaking noobs and river rats floating right into the main squeeze.  Then they all post up on the beach too.  Getting rides in between the train of people stalling out in the seam as they float down can be a challenge.  Or if you feel really dialed in see how many people you can sink under in one ride.  My record was five.   After talking with a local who swims with goggles there, it sounded like the spot is constantly shifting.  A big rock near the top of the seam he used to hang on to and watch us drop in had tumbled in a month ago.  It sounds like this spot is very Japnese in nature, so get it while the getting is good!

Like the prior versions, it is both a lefty and righty, it\\s all up to your entry preference.  \r\nIt\\s got more turbulence than it used to have prior to Hurricane Irene but is still a very smooth drop with many entry styles allowed.  \r\nWe used to tap in from the river left side, but now we approach the seam from river right.  There is still that little eddy that is above the seam- you can tap into and get a weird ride that may keep you right there, kind of vibrating your boat, maybe bouncing you off the eddy walls a bit.  There, you may pop back up with no travel, or you might get lucky and drop over the ledge into the deeper valley in the riverbed.  If you charc in high, meaning into the eddy, there is a chance that you may sink down to land on top of a big ol\\ rock that sits there for you to more or less be \\stuck\\ on while you spin (look at P Lo\\s hull).  I think that rock is easiest found when you go in lefty??  I always enter righty there and only hit the rock twice.  I also think that once you get sucked under, you can wing your way to the river left support side of the seam and miss the rock, plus enter the deepest part of the valley for a ride with great support.  On the river right side (Cold River side), the water is more brownish, while on the other side of the seam, the water is blue-grey to green, depending where you roam.  \r\nWhat we have found is that CJ is still awesome down to maybe around 625.  At that lower flow, the spot is so smooth, and you still can go deep for long lung busting rides.  I personally think that 1000 cfs and 825 is better than 900.  It might have something to do with the surges that cause the whirlies to whip up.  When it\\s low, there aren\\t really any surges causing cones that can f*ck up your entry. \r\nThe only real hazards are:  tubers, rafters, kayakers, and cops.  They are everywhere on sunny days.

The flow today also seemed higher and more forceful than I remembered at 2.9.  The seam was ill defined and was more of a bulging herniated mound.  The upstream edge had little form and curved and meandered.  My exploratory entry charc into the center of the fishladder flow sank me quickly and with out of control force. I had both my compression vest and my pfd on and was using my stick. I surfaced downstream alongside the rock and had to use an amphibious attainment.  Probing the upstream edge of the confluence without my vest resulted in some mediocre head under rides with little umph and the current tended to push you into the upstream eddy after a few seconds.  I had a spooky ride entering the main current solidly in the right side of the fish ladder flow and sank easily so that my head for 3 feet under. After a few spins, I got a double suck that had my hurtling towards the bottom. I saw dark shapes on the bottom and continued to descend even though I put on the brakes and was madly grabbing water with my hand paddles above my head to no avail.  After what seemed like an eternity, but was mostly likely 3-4 seconds i finally began to rise and I exited with a black attack much to my relief.  Be careful out there until we figure out the new conditions.

The other charc involves trying for the no travel rides by charcing in 3 feet upstream of the meat. Dance on the edge and keep your tips out of the meat, but give some paddle pushes back towards the meat when the current tries to return service you back into the eddy.

You do have to contend with a little bit of Tupperware here, but they are interested in the really good surf wave.  \r\n\r\nFor those not familiar with this spot there are two playboat features; a small wave at the top of the Eddy and another much bigger wave 30-35 feet down stream.

Use this little point as your reference point and try to engage the seam 6 to 8 feet downstream of it.

I started experimenting with this seam and after 7 or 8 tries started getting some decent rides using a regular right charc.  My perserverance paid off here and by the end of the session I was getting some epic downtime.  The Charc I was using is as follows: I would paddle to the top of the eddy and try to get as close as possible to the little pourover, which is not that easy.  You need to keep your bow up to get past the first seam, which is tempting you to engage.  Dont enter this first seam, instead, ferry out 3 to 4 feet and look for a building 1 foot wave coming down at you.  Drop your bow a foot under water here and wing down.  When you hit it right it will drop you to about 4 or 5 feet into calm green water where you can start spinning away.  It will feel like you are travelling no where, which is rarely the case. Sometimes you hit a subtle double suck that will take you to 8 or 9 feet--the double suck is smooth and sweet. When you hit it you will come up 80 to 100 feet downstream!!',0,'2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400', '2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400');

During the late summer when we first found DZL, we were only getting releases in the Yakima and the Tieton was nearly empty, so the levels being reported were basically 90 - 95% from the Yakima. Now, during snow melt, the guage is picking up all the additional outflow from the Tieton AND the flows from the Yakima. We will need to do some more exploring duing the Spring to determine the appropriate levels when the Tieton is adding more water to the guage reading. . .

It was between 3100 and 4500 while I was there and believe it or not it did not change much with the increase in flow.  This is a really cool spot with tons of potential.

First off the phone is still off.  Subtract .12 from the phone reading to get the actual gauge reading--this pretty much works for any level.  We held the eddyline squirt comp at Bermuda this past weekend and there were several rides, myself included where the up-button did not want to work.  Today, about .05 lower which is about 250 less cfs, I still got jostled around a little with the stick.  However, the hand-paddle rides were smooth and there were no up button malfunctions.  The spring also seems to have deposited some rock in the upstream eddy that is only about 4 feet deep--I have tapped it on quite a few rides going upstream but it is friendly as far as rocks go.

What a way to break in the new seams that Paul recently did for both of us.  Both of us were hitting great rides!  A long ride (15-20) usually requires an easy amphibian attainment on attainers right.  There are three eddies that you can stage in: river right(rr), top river left (tl) and lower river left (ll).  Initiating from rr tended to put you into the rock wall on river right and was therefore my least favorite eddy to engage from.  Stro and I both engaged mostly from ll.  This tended to keep you in the flow and give you lots of travel.  tl would give rides at the corner of the convergence with little to no travel.  I only tapped a few rocks gently at around 7 feet--I actually think it was the same rock I hit twice.  Still not sure what the lower and upper end of this spot is.

The higher levels get harder as the eddy line gets burly.\r\n\r\nCats is a powered up squirt spot to say the least.  The main spot is on river left at the very bottom of the rapid.  The main flow piles up on a large rock and falls off to the right side.  This flow meets with the flow heading from center right to left and makes a squeeze of sorts.  \r\n\r\nThe main problem with the spot is the inconsistent and turbulent eddy line.  The eddy boils and surges as you are moving up stream to charc in.  This boiling eddy is the reason for the spots inconsistency.  Other than that it is as good a spot as any.  \r\n\r\nThe charc is a traditional lefty right beside the rock.  I try and get as much of my boat up and into the slab as possible before I initiate.  The charc is hard and aggressive but when you hit it right it will send your ass to the bottom of the river.\r\n\r\nThe initial drop takes you down 5 or 6 feet.  If you manage to hold on through this initial drop you will find yourself falling off a shelf that takes you down to the 8-10 foot range.  Depending on the ride you will sometimes drop 4-5 feet more.  These rides are dynamic!  Sometimes you will stay in the big eddy on river left and sometimes you will traverse across the river ending up on river right in the big right eddy (coast to coast rides).  And some times you do both.  \r\n\r\nA good ride here can be between 20 and 30 seconds if you get the good deep ones.  The spot serves up consistent 15-20 second rides for the veteran who spends enough time here to figure it out.\r\n\r\nThe channel is clean and safe for the most part.  I never fear anything here during a mystery with the exception of a few rogue rafts here and there.  There are a few rocks down there in the deep channel and I have hit them all.

Friday I hiked a Ninja in down the trail at Carnifex Ferry State Park, and put in below Pillow.  Had a great first day getting used to the spot.  Stashed my boat on river left in the woods then swam across the river and hiked back up.  Saturday I ran the upper in plastic, stopped and switched boats, and had another 3 sessions before continuing downstream.  Sunday I hiked into Pillow, swam across the river, 4 more sessions.  Then I floated down a few more rapids to the top of Lost Paddle and got out river RIGHT and hiked out.  Monday I ran downstream in my Jet and had another great session with Maverick before hiking out to Carnifex again.  By stashing a boat for several days I was really able to dial in the spot and spend all my energy there without worrying about getting too exhausted before lost paddle. \r\nNEW ACCESS BETA:\r\n A few hundred yards above the confluence with the Meadow and the top of Lost Paddle find a beach on river RIGHT (big enough to park 4 rafts, and surrounded by rippled blocks 6-8 feet high).  Walk downstream until the beach turns into a trail and take 2 rights up into the woods.  Here you find a wide trail that ascends back to the Carnifex Ferry SP.  This hike out takes 30 minutes and is very enjoyable!  Because it follows the old horse and wagon trail from days when the ferry was the only way across, it never gets steeper than 10 degrees.  Much better than trying to he man up the pillow rock trail.  By the way, if you DO decide to hike out at pillow, make sure to put in at the pool ABOVE sweet cheeks to ferry back over.  Word is that river right bank next to SC is all jungled out with huge rocks that are a pain in the ass to portage over.  Hit the pool above and it\\\\s a quick bit of clear rock hopping upstream to the trail.  Going downstream to the Carnifex Ferry trail is much gentler on the body overall.  PS history buffs:  you can find old stone bunkers from the Civil War Battle in the woods above the trail.  Imagine being a soldier shooting at the enemy from behind your pile of rocks...  When the trail takes a sharp left, following a side creek and the river noise goes away, don\\\\t worry you\\\\re still on the right path.  Sweet Cheeks has a high price of admission:  You either run Insignificant and Pillow or  you have to gut it out and walk down the STEEP pillow rock trail.  But it\\\\s worth it!  For those who aren\\\\t up for running downstream in a park and sink boat, the hike in is well worth it, especially if you can stash it a few days.  To drive to Carnifex Ferry continue south on 129 past the summersville dam a couple miles.  When the road takes a 90 degree right at Kessler Cross Lanes, take a left onto Carnifex Ferry Road? until the road ends and the park.  The trail down to Pillow rock starts left of the overlook, and the trail up from the ferry comes out behind the shelters to the right.  \r\n  CHARCS:  \r\n  At 2800 it\\\\s perfect.  Attainer\\\\s right is an eddy with return service.  From the eddy you surf a little wave 20 feet left.  As I surf over, I try to get high on the wave so as it ends I am charging down the face with extra upstream momentum.  Crossing another 10 feet of fast current takes you to the seam.  This is where having a stick comes in handy, 4 quick strokes gets me a lot higher on the seam than handpaddlers.  I was going left, initiating into the river right current, which goes under the river left current.  I was chopping in with a big stern pry on my left and then keeping it extended in a stiff arm and having great results.  Most everybody else goes righty and backcut here though.  Underwater it is smooth as butter once you\\\\re down.  20 seconds every time for dialed in sinkers.  The real surprise was on Monday when I was nailing 5-15 second rides in my Jet!  This was my starter boat and is cut HIGH and has puffed up volume around the toes.  First I put a 20 pound rock in my lap as ballast, but then I was getting rides without it too!  Of all the spots in WV I\\\\ve tried to sink that thing, this is probably the easiest to get a bigger boat DOWN.  We\\\\re talking Twisted Sister style easy entry without the scare factor.  \r\n   At 3200 it starts to wash out.  The seam is still right there but the wave is starting to disappear and the last 10 feet of current is FAST.  Handpaddlers and LOW boats don\\\\t bother.  Big boats and sticks could probably get good rides, but the current is starting to intrude into the eddy and you really have to fight to get back upstream.  \r\n  At 2000 it gets a lot weaker, and the most powerful part of the squeeze seems to move downstream.  Also entry wave is not as perfectly formed so it is difficult to keep upstream position on the ferry out.  The underwater rock on river right is starting to become visible, it is 45 degrees to the current and it becomes clear to the observer why there is such a strong current dropping off there.  \r\n    HEARSAY:\r\n  Steve O said one old schooler who loved the spot said the BEST level was 1500.  Maybe team Fayettenam will do some exploring next summer?  Ricky said Chuck Kern used to charc in, drop his paddle and get 30 seconds, coming up left at the very bottom of the eddy.  J Pou was told by somebody if you start getting really long and deep rides, watch out for a couple rocks 15-20 seconds in.  You may bump against 2 for a second, but don\\\\t worry, just hang out and you will go up and over them.  You CAN go lefty!  On river right above the spot, there is a really nice surf wave, all day glassy carving.  When you are ready to take a break from sinking, put in at the pool above, and ferry over for a nice surf.  From the spot you can look upstream and see rafts getting flipped on Volkswagen Rock.  If you are going downstream with other non-sinkers, you can usually convince them to watch carnage at Pillow for a bit while you get a session in.  It is also great fun to get rides underneath your friends in plastic who may have not seen mysteries before.  ',0,'2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400', '2019-09-10 12:03:55 -0400');

One at the top of the channel, one at the deltoid rock and one at the very bottom of the channel.  At the 750 level, nothing was happening at the top or deltoid rock.  But, at the bottom, there was a little downtime to be had.   At the lower part of the channel, the water drops off a shoal and there is a down stream flow plus a flow off the river left bank.  The Charc that was working for me was to enter the flow from the river right side of the channel accessing the flow coming off the left bank by initiating my bow and then dropping my hip and linking the stern with the downstream flow.   It was almost an auto drop.  By the end of my session, I was head under almost every time.   It\\\\s not very deep here, but deep enough.  Water quality was fantastic.

Amazing setting, classic structure of 2 huge slabs running into each other.  Like the Y in Tennessee but way more power.  Chop in however you want.  If it\\\\s on the seam near the top you\\\\re going down.  I have never seen such well formed whirlpool structures, big ones shear off at the top and can be seen extending 10 feet down.  If you drop high and fast, you can hover at the bottom of the river with hardly any travel.  Blue angel rides are out, you can resurface anywhere.  Chop in the river left slab and you can stall easier on the sloping rubble bar of tumbled granite.  Pretty turbulent  deep and high on the seam but as you roam downstream it smoothes out and keeps taking you deeper until you hover just a couple feet off the bottom.   Probably 15 feet deep?   I was pushing the up button on half of my rides.  I almost went back to the car  a couple times to get my PFD, it took about 5 seconds to resurface after you pushed the up button!

No shade or trees for hammocks. Pretty friendly for any visitors bringing family with small children.  Except for crossing the road the trail to the river is not steep.  There is a wide area of shallow water, the seam is about 50 feet away from the beach.  On weekends there is a constant stream of Massachusetts finest collections of rednecks, coeds, raft customers, drinkers, smokers, tubers, kayaking noobs and river rats floating right into the main squeeze.  Then they all post up on the beach too.  Getting rides in between the train of people stalling out in the seam as they float down can be a challenge.  Or if you feel really dialed in see how many people you can sink under in one ride.  My record was five.   After talking with a local who swims with goggles there, it sounded like the spot is constantly shifting.  A big rock near the top of the seam he used to hang on to and watch us drop in had tumbled in a month ago.  It sounds like this spot is very Japnese in nature, so get it while the getting is good!

Like the prior versions, it is both a lefty and righty, it\\s all up to your entry preference.  \r\nIt\\s got more turbulence than it used to have prior to Hurricane Irene but is still a very smooth drop with many entry styles allowed.  \r\nWe used to tap in from the river left side, but now we approach the seam from river right.  There is still that little eddy that is above the seam- you can tap into and get a weird ride that may keep you right there, kind of vibrating your boat, maybe bouncing you off the eddy walls a bit.  There, you may pop back up with no travel, or you might get lucky and drop over the ledge into the deeper valley in the riverbed.  If you charc in high, meaning into the eddy, there is a chance that you may sink down to land on top of a big ol\\ rock that sits there for you to more or less be \\stuck\\ on while you spin (look at P Lo\\s hull).  I think that rock is easiest found when you go in lefty??  I always enter righty there and only hit the rock twice.  I also think that once you get sucked under, you can wing your way to the river left support side of the seam and miss the rock, plus enter the deepest part of the valley for a ride with great support.  On the river right side (Cold River side), the water is more brownish, while on the other side of the seam, the water is blue-grey to green, depending where you roam.  \r\nWhat we have found is that CJ is still awesome down to maybe around 625.  At that lower flow, the spot is so smooth, and you still can go deep for long lung busting rides.  I personally think that 1000 cfs and 825 is better than 900.  It might have something to do with the surges that cause the whirlies to whip up.  When it\\s low, there aren\\t really any surges causing cones that can f*ck up your entry. \r\nThe only real hazards are:  tubers, rafters, kayakers, and cops.  They are everywhere on sunny days.  The river traffic has dramatically increased in the past 5 years to the point that the local cops started to float the river with the riffraff.  Ideally, you\\d be sinking when the weather isn\\t as inviting, or during the week, at least during the hight of summer.  \r\nThe release schedule should be taken with a grain of salt- the best way to know what\\s going to happen with the flow is to call the FLOWLINE!!!!!
